177847,Milk is based on the life of a person.,Milk_(film),"Milk is a 2008 American biographical film based on the life of gay rights activist and politician Harvey Milk , who was the first openly gay person to be elected to public office in California , as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors . Directed by Gus Van Sant and written by Dustin Lance Black , the film stars Sean Penn as Milk and Josh Brolin as Dan White , a city supervisor who assassinated Milk and Mayor George Moscone . The film was released to much acclaim and earned numerous accolades from film critics and guilds . Ultimately , it received eight Academy Award nominations , including Best Picture , winning two for Best Actor in a Leading Role for Penn and Best Original Screenplay for Black .   Attempts to put Milk 's life to film followed a 1984 documentary of his life and the aftermath of his assassination , titled The Times of Harvey Milk , which was loosely based upon Randy Shilts 's biography , The Mayor of Castro Street ( the film won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature for 1984 , and was awarded Special Jury Prize at the first Sundance Film Festival , among other awards ) . Various scripts were considered in the early 1990s , but projects fell through for different reasons , until 2007 . Much of Milk was filmed on Castro Street and other locations in San Francisco , including Milk 's former storefront , Castro Camera .   Milk begins on Harvey Milk 's 40th birthday ( in 1970 ) , when he was living in New York City and had not yet settled in San Francisco . It chronicles his foray into city politics , and the various battles he waged in the Castro neighborhood as well as throughout the city , and political campaigns to limit the rights of gay people in 1977 and 1978 run by Anita Bryant and John Briggs . His romantic and political relationships are also addressed , as is his tenuous affiliation with troubled Supervisor Dan White ; the film ends with White 's double homicide of Milk and Mayor George Moscone . The film 's release was tied to the 2008 California voter referendum on gay marriage , Proposition 8 , when it made its premiere at the Castro Theatre two weeks before election day .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Among his novels are The Adventures of Tom Sawyer ( 1876 ) and its sequel , the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn ( 1885 ) , the latter often called `` The Great American Novel '' .   Twain was raised in Hannibal , Missouri , which later provided the setting for Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn . He served an apprenticeship with a printer and then worked as a typesetter , contributing articles to the newspaper of his older brother Orion Clemens . He later became a riverboat pilot on the Mississippi River before heading west to join Orion in Nevada . He referred humorously to his lack of success at mining , turning to journalism for the Virginia City Territorial Enterprise . His humorous story , `` The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County '' , was published in 1865 , based on a story that he heard at Angels Hotel in Angels Camp , California where he had spent some time as a miner . The short story brought international attention and was even translated into classic Greek . His wit and satire , in prose and in speech , earned praise from critics and peers , and he was a friend to presidents , artists , industrialists , and European royalty .   Twain earned a great deal of money from his writings and lectures , but he invested in ventures that lost most of it -- notably the Paige Compositor , a mechanical typesetter that failed because of its complexity and imprecision . He filed for bankruptcy in the wake of these financial setbacks , but he eventually overcame his financial troubles with the help of Henry Huttleston Rogers . He chose to pay all his pre-bankruptcy creditors in full , even after he had no legal responsibility to do so .   Twain was born shortly after an appearance of Halley 's Comet , and he predicted that he would `` go out with it '' as well ; he died the day after the comet returned . He was lauded as the `` greatest American humorist of his age '' , and William Faulkner called him `` the father of American literature '' .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

51379,The Siege of Fort Stanwix took place.,Siege_of_Fort_Stanwix,"The Siege of Fort Stanwix ( also known at the time as Fort Schuyler ) began on August 2 , 1777 , and ended August 22 . Fort Stanwix , in the western part of the Mohawk River Valley , was then the primary defense point for the Continental Army against British and Indian forces aligned against them in the American Revolutionary War . The fort was occupied by Continental Army forces from New York and Massachusetts under the command of Colonel Peter Gansevoort . The besieging force was composed of British regulars , American Loyalists , Hessian soldiers from Hesse-Hanau , and Indians , under the command of British Brigadier General Barry St. Leger and the Iroquois leader Joseph Brant . St. Leger 's expedition was a diversion in support of General John Burgoyne 's campaign to gain control of the Hudson River Valley to the east .   One attempt at relief was thwarted early in the siege when a force of New York militia under Nicholas Herkimer was stopped in the August 6 Battle of Oriskany by a detachment of St. Leger 's forces . While that battle did not involve the fort 's garrison , some of its occupants sortied and raided the nearly empty Indian and Loyalist camps , which was a blow to the morale of St. Leger 's Indian support . They killed some Seneca . The siege was finally broken when American reinforcements under the command of Benedict Arnold neared , and Arnold used a ruse , with the assistance of Herkimer 's relative Hon Yost Schuyler , to convince the besiegers that a much larger force was arriving . This misinformation , combined with the departure of Indian fighters not interested in siege warfare and upset over their losses from the raids , led St. Leger to abandon the effort and retreat .   St. Leger 's failure to advance on Albany contributed to Burgoyne 's surrender following the Battles of Saratoga in October 1777 . Although St. Leger reached Fort Ticonderoga in late September , he was too late to aid Burgoyne .   The first official US flag was flown during battle on August 3 , 1777 , at Fort Schuyler . The Continental Congress adopted the following resolution on June 14 , 1777 : `` Resolved , that the flag of the United States be thirteen stripes , alternate red and white ; that the union be thirteen stars , white , on a blue field , representing a new constellation . '' There was a delay in displaying this flag . The resolution was not signed by the secretary of the Congress until September 3 , though it was previously printed in the newspapers . Massachusetts reinforcements to Fort Schuyler brought news of the adoption by Congress of the official flag . Soldiers cut up their shirts to make the white stripes ; scarlet material was secured from red flannel petticoats of officers ' wives , while material for the blue union was secured from Capt. Abraham Swartwout 's blue cloth coat . A voucher shows that Congress paid Capt. Swartwout for his coat for the flag .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

As the first United States Ambassador to France , he exemplified the emerging American nation . Franklin was foundational in defining the American ethos as a marriage of the practical values of thrift , hard work , education , community spirit , self-governing institutions , and opposition to authoritarianism both political and religious , with the scientific and tolerant values of the Enlightenment . In the words of historian Henry Steele Commager , `` In a Franklin could be merged the virtues of Puritanism without its defects , the illumination of the Enlightenment without its heat . '' To Walter Isaacson , this makes Franklin `` the most accomplished American of his age and the most influential in inventing the type of society America would become .

During the Revolution , he became the first US Postmaster General . He was active in community affairs and colonial and state politics , as well as national and international affairs . From 1785 to 1788 , he served as governor of Pennsylvania . He initially owned and dealt in slaves but , by the 1750s , he argued against slavery from an economic perspective and became one of the most prominent abolitionists .   His colorful life and legacy of scientific and political achievement , and his status as one of America 's most influential Founding Fathers have seen Franklin honored more than two centuries after his death on coinage and the $ 100 bill , warships , and the names of many towns , counties , educational institutions , and corporations , as well as countless cultural references .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Bastia , the prefecture city of Haute-Corse , is the second-largest settlement in Corsica .   After being ruled by the Republic of Genoa since 1284 , Corsica was briefly an independent Corsican Republic from 1755 until it was conquered by France in 1769 . Due to Corsica 's historical ties with the Italian peninsula , the island retains to this day many elements of the culture of Italy .

Species distribution is not to be confused with dispersal , which is the movement of individuals away from their area of origin or from centers of high on density . A similar concept is the species range . A species range is often represented with a species range map . Biogeographers try to understand the factors determining a species ' distribution . The pattern of distribution is not permanent for each species . Distribution patterns can change seasonally , in response to the availability of resources , and also depending on the scale at which they are viewed . Dispersion usually takes place at the time of reproduction . Populations within a species are translocated through many methods , including dispersal by people , wind , water and animals . Humans are one of the largest distributors due to the current trends in globalization and the expanse of the transportation industry . For example , large tankers often fill their ballasts with water at one port and empty them in another , causing a wider distribution of aquatic species .   Biogeography is the study of the distribution of biodiversity over space and time . It is very useful in understanding species distribution through factors such as speciation , extinction , continental drift , glaciation , variation of sea levels , river capture and available resources . This branch of study not only gives a description of the species distribution , but also a geographical explanation for the distribution of particular species . The traditional biogeographic regions were first modeled by Alfred Wallace in The Geographical Distribution of Animals ( 1876 ) . These were based on the work of Sclater 's terrestrial biogeographic regions . Wallace 's system was based on both birds and vertebrates , including non-flying mammals , which better reflect the natural divisions of the Earth due to their limited dispersal abilities .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

79429,The Vandals migrated around Europe.,Vandals,"The Vandals were an East Germanic tribe , or group of tribes , who were first heard of in southern Poland , but later moved around Europe establishing kingdoms in Spain and later North Africa in the 5th century .   The Vandals are believed to have migrated from southern Scandinavia to the area between the lower Oder and Vistula rivers during the 2nd century BC and to have settled in Silesia from around 120 BC . They are associated with the Przeworsk culture and were possibly the same people as the Lugii . Expanding into Dacia during the Marcomannic Wars and to Pannonia during the Crisis of the Third Century , the Vandals were confined to Pannonia by the Goths around 330 AD , where they received permission to settle by Constantine the Great . Around 400 , raids by the Huns forced many of the Germanic tribes like the Goths to migrate to the Roman Empire , and fearing that they might be targeted next , the Vandals were pushed westwards crossing the Rhine into Gaul along with other tribes in 406 . In 409 , the Vandals crossed the Pyrenees into the Iberian Peninsula , where their main groups , the Hasdingi and the Silingi , settled in Gallaecia ( northwest ) and Baetica ( south central ) respectively .   After the Visigoths invaded Iberia , the Iranian Alans and Silingi Vandals voluntarily subjected to the rule of Hasdingian leader Gunderic , who was pushed from Gallaecia to Baetica by a Roman-Suebi coalition in 419 . In 429 , under king Genseric , the Vandals entered North Africa . By 439 they established a kingdom which included the Roman province of Africa as well as Sicily , Corsica , Sardinia , Malta and the Balearic Islands . They fended off several Roman attempts to recapture the African province , and sacked the city of Rome in 455 . Their kingdom collapsed in the Vandalic War of 533 -- 4 , in which Justinian I managed to reconquer the province for the Eastern Roman Empire .   Renaissance and Early Modern writers characterized the Vandals as barbarians , `` sacking and looting '' Rome . This led to the use of the term `` vandalism '' to describe any senseless destruction , particularly the `` barbarian '' defacing of artwork . However , modern historians tend to regard the Vandals during the transitional period from Late Antiquity to the Early Middle Ages as perpetuators , not destroyers , of Roman culture .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

He was a direct descendant of Turco-Mongol conqueror Timur ( Tamurlane ) from the Barlas clan , through his father , and also a descendant of Genghis Khan through his mother . He was also influenced by the Persian culture and this affected both his own actions and those of his successors , giving rise to a significant expansion of the Persianate ethos in the Indian subcontinent .   Babur was the eldest son of Umar Sheikh Mirza . He ascended the throne of Fergana in 1495 at the age of twelve and faced rebellion from his own relatives . He conquered Samarkand two years later , only to lose the city of Fergana soon after . In his attempt to reconquer Fergana , he lost control of Samarkand . In 1501 , his attempt to recapture both cities went in vain as he was defeated by Muhammad Shaybani Khan . In 1504 , he conquered Kabul , which was under the rule of the infant heir of Ulugh Begh . Babur formed a partnership with Safavid ruler Ismail I and reconquered parts of central Asia , including Samarkand , only to again lose it and the other newly conquered lands to the Uzbeks .   After losing Samarkand for the third time , Babur turned his attention to creating his empire in north India . At that time , the Indo-Gangetic Plain of the northern Indian Subcontinent was ruled by Ibrahim Lodi of the Afghan Lodi dynasty , whereas Rajputana was ruled by a Hindu Rajput Confederacy , led by Rana Sanga of Mewar . In 1524 , Daulat Khan Lodi , a rebel of the Lodhi dynasty , invited Babur to overthrow Ibrahim and become ruler . Babur defeated Ibrahim Lodi at the First Battle of Panipat in 1526 and founded the Mughal empire . However , he again faced opposition , this time from Rana Sanga of Mewar who considered Babur a foreigner . The Rana was defeated at the Battle of Khanwa .   Babur married several times . Notable among his sons are Humayun , Kamran Mirza and Hindal Mirza . Babur died in 1530 and was succeeded by Humayun . According to Babur 's wishes , he was buried in Bagh-e-Babur in Kabul , Afghanistan . Being a patrilineal descendant of Timur , Babur considered himself a Timurid and Turk , though Uzbek sources claim him as an ethnic Uzbek . He is considered a national hero in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan . Many of his poems also have become popular folk songs .

Yemen is the second-largest country in the peninsula , occupying 527,970 km2 ( 203,850 sq mi ) . The coastline stretches for about 2,000 km ( 1,200 mi ) . It is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the north , the Red Sea to the west , the Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea to the south , and Oman to the east-northeast . Although Yemen 's constitutionally stated capital is the city of Sana'a , the city has been under rebel control since February 2015 . Because of this , Yemen 's capital has been temporarily relocated to the port city of Aden , on the southern coast . Yemen 's territory includes more than 200 islands ; the largest of these is Socotra .   Yemen was the home of the Sabaeans ( biblical Sheba ) , a trading state that flourished for over a thousand years and also included parts of modern-day Ethiopia and Eritrea . In 275 AD , the region came under the rule of the later Jewish-influenced Himyarite Kingdom . Christianity arrived in the fourth century , whereas Judaism and local paganism were already established . Islam spread quickly in the seventh century and Yemenite troops were crucial in the expansion of the early Islamic conquests . Administration of Yemen has long been notoriously difficult . Several dynasties emerged from the ninth to 16th centuries , the Rasulid dynasty being the strongest and most prosperous . The country was divided between the Ottoman and British empires in the early twentieth century . The Zaydi Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen was established after World War I in North Yemen before the creation of the Yemen Arab Republic in 1962 . South Yemen remained a British protectorate known as the Aden Protectorate until 1967 when it became an independent state and later , a Marxist state . The two Yemeni states united to form the modern republic of Yemen in 1990 .   Yemen is a developing country , and the poorest country in the Middle East . Under the rule of President Ali Abdullah Saleh , Yemen was described as a kleptocracy . According to the 2009 international corruption Perception Index by Transparency International , Yemen ranked 164 out of 182 countries surveyed . In the absence of strong state institutions , elite politics in Yemen constituted a de facto form of collaborative governance , where competing tribal , regional , religious , and political interests agreed to hold themselves in check through tacit acceptance of the balance it produced . The informal political settlement was held together by a power-sharing deal between three men : president Ali Abdullah Saleh , who controlled the state ; Major General Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar , who controlled the largest share of the Republic of Yemen Armed Forces ; and Abdullah ibn Husayn al-Ahmar , figurehead of the Islamist Islah party and Saudi Arabia 's chosen broker of transnational patronage payments to various political players , including tribal sheikhs . The Saudi payments have been intended to facilitate the tribes ' autonomy from the Yemeni government and to give the Saudi government a mechanism with which to weigh in on Yemen 's political decision-making .   Yemen has been in a state of political crisis since 2011 , starting with street protests against poverty , unemployment , corruption , and president Saleh 's plan to amend Yemen 's constitution and eliminate the presidential term limit , in effect making him president for life . President Saleh stepped down and the powers of the presidency were transferred to Vice President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi , who was formally elected president on 21 February 2012 in a one-man election . The transitional process was disrupted by conflicts between the Houthis and al-Islah , as well as the al-Qaeda insurgency . In September 2014 , the Houthis took over Sana'a , later declaring themselves in control of the government in a coup d'état . Since then , a Saudi-led intervention has taken place , however , it could not stop the civil war . The Saudi-led intervention has caused massive damage to Yemeni infrastructure and has resulted in the bombing of hospitals and funeral processions among other civilian targets .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Sometimes called The Virgin Queen , Gloriana or Good Queen Bess , the childless Elizabeth was the last monarch of the Tudor dynasty .   Elizabeth was the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn , his second wife , who was executed two-and-a-half years after Elizabeth 's birth . Anne 's marriage to Henry VIII was annulled , and Elizabeth was declared illegitimate . Her half-brother , Edward VI , ruled until his death in 1553 , bequeathing the crown to Lady Jane Grey and ignoring the claims of his two half-sisters , Elizabeth and the Roman Catholic Mary , in spite of statute law to the contrary . Edward 's will was set aside and Mary became queen , deposing Lady Jane Grey . During Mary 's reign , Elizabeth was imprisoned for nearly a year on suspicion of supporting Protestant rebels .   In 1558 , Elizabeth succeeded her half-sister to the throne and set out to rule by good counsel . She depended heavily on a group of trusted advisers , led by William Cecil , 1st Baron Burghley . One of her first actions as queen was the establishment of an English Protestant church , of which she became the Supreme Governor . This Elizabethan Religious Settlement was to evolve into the Church of England . It was expected that Elizabeth would marry and produce an heir to continue the Tudor line . She never did , despite numerous courtships . As she grew older , Elizabeth became famous for her virginity . A cult grew around her which was celebrated in the portraits , pageants , and literature of the day .   In government , Elizabeth was more moderate than her father and half-siblings had been . One of her mottoes was `` video et taceo '' ( `` I see but say nothing '' ) . In religion , she was relatively tolerant and avoided systematic persecution . After the pope declared her illegitimate in 1570 and released her subjects from obedience to her , several conspiracies threatened her life , all of which were defeated with the help of her ministers ' secret service . Elizabeth was cautious in foreign affairs , manoeuvring between the major powers of France and Spain . She only half-heartedly supported a number of ineffective , poorly resourced military campaigns in the Netherlands , France , and Ireland . By the mid-1580s , England could no longer avoid war with Spain . England 's defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 associated Elizabeth with one of the greatest military victories in English history .   Elizabeth 's reign is known as the Elizabethan era . The period is famous for the flourishing of English drama , led by playwrights such as William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe , and for the seafaring prowess of English adventurers such as Francis Drake . Some historians depict Elizabeth as a short-tempered , sometimes indecisive ruler , who enjoyed more than her share of luck . Towards the end of her reign , a series of economic and military problems weakened her popularity . Elizabeth is acknowledged as a charismatic performer and a dogged survivor in an era when government was ramshackle and limited , and when monarchs in neighbouring countries faced internal problems that jeopardised their thrones . Such was the case with Elizabeth 's rival , Mary , Queen of Scots , whom she imprisoned in 1568 and had executed in 1587 . After the short reigns of Elizabeth 's half-siblings , her 44 years on the throne provided welcome stability for the kingdom and helped forge a sense of national identity .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

With 1,615,017 people , Phoenix is the fifth most populous city nationwide , the most populous state capital in the United States , and the only state capital with a population of more than one million residents .   Phoenix is the anchor of the Phoenix metropolitan area , also known as the Valley of the Sun , which in turn is a part of the Salt River Valley . The metropolitan area is the 12th largest by population in the United States , with approximately 4.3 million people . In addition , Phoenix is the seat of Maricopa County and , at 517.9 square miles ( 1,341 km2 ) , it is the largest city in the state , more than twice the size of Tucson and one of the largest cities in the United States .   Settled in 1867 as an agricultural community near the confluence of the Salt and Gila Rivers , Phoenix incorporated as a city in 1881 . Located in the northeastern reaches of the Sonoran Desert , Phoenix has a subtropical desert climate . Despite this , its canal system led to a thriving farming community , many of the original crops remaining important parts of the Phoenix economy for decades , such as alfalfa , cotton , citrus , and hay ( which was important for the cattle industry ) . In fact , the `` Five C 's '' ( Cotton , Cattle , Citrus , Climate , and Copper ) , remained the driving forces of Phoenix 's economy until after World War II , when high-tech industries began to move into the valley and air conditioning made residences much more comfortable in the very hot summers .   The city averaged a four percent annual population growth rate over a 40-year period from the mid-1960s to the mid-2000s . This growth rate slowed during the Great Recession of 2007 -- 09 , and has rebounded slowly . Phoenix is the cultural center of the Valley of the Sun , as well as the entire state .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

With a total height of 829.8 m including the antenna and a roof height of 828 m , the Burj Khalifa is currently the tallest structure in the world since topping out in late 2008 .   Construction of the Burj Khalifa began in 2004 , with the exterior completed 5 years later in 2009 . The primary structure is reinforced concrete . The building was opened in 2010 as part of a new development called Downtown Dubai . It is designed to be the centrepiece of large-scale , mixed-use development . The decision to construct the building is reportedly based on the government 's decision to diversify from an oil-based economy , and for Dubai to gain international recognition . The building was named in honour of the ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the United Arab Emirates , Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan ; Abu Dhabi and the UAE government lent Dubai money to pay its debts . The building broke numerous height records , including its designation as the tallest tower in the world .   Burj Khalifa was designed by Adrian Smith , then of Skidmore , Owings & Merrill ( SOM ) , whose firm designed the Willis Tower and One World Trade Center . Hyder Consulting was chosen to be the supervising engineer with NORR Group Consultants International Limited chosen to supervise the architecture of the project . The design is derived from the Islamic architecture of the region , such as in the Great Mosque of Samarra . The Y-shaped tripartite floor geometry is designed to optimize residential and hotel space . A buttressed central core and wings are used to support the height of the building . Although this design was derived from Tower Palace III , the Burj Khalifa 's central core houses all vertical transportation with the exception of egress stairs within each of the wings . The structure also features a cladding system which is designed to withstand Dubai 's hot summer temperatures . It contains a total of 57 elevators and 8 escalators .   Critical reception to Burj Khalifa has been generally positive , and the building has received many awards . However , the labour issues during construction were controversial , since the building was built primarily by migrant workers from South Asia with several allegations of mistreatment . Poor working conditions are common , as the result of the lack of minimum wage laws in the United Arab Emirates . Several instances of suicides have been reported , which is not uncommon for migrant construction workers in Dubai despite safety precautions in place .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

7782,A near-Earth object is one whose orbit brings it into proximity with Earth.,Near-Earth_object,"A near-Earth object ( NEO ) is any small Solar System body whose orbit brings it into proximity with Earth . By definition , a solar system body is a NEO if its closest approach to the Sun ( perihelion ) is less than 1.3 astronomical unit ( AU ) . NEOs include more than fourteen thousand near-Earth asteroids ( NEAs ) , more than one hundred near-Earth comets ( NECs ) , and a number of solar-orbiting spacecraft and meteoroids , large enough to be tracked in space before striking the Earth . It is now widely accepted that collisions in the past have had a significant role in shaping the geological and biological history of the Earth . NEOs have become of increased interest since the 1980s because of increased awareness of the potential danger some of the asteroids or comets pose , and mitigations are being researched . In January 2016 , NASA announced the Planetary Defense Coordination Office to track NEOs larger than 30 to 50 meters in diameter and coordinate an effective threat response and mitigation effort .   NEAs have orbits that lie partly between 0.983 and 1.3 AU away from the Sun . When a NEA is detected it is submitted to the IAU 's Minor Planet Center for cataloging . Some NEAs orbits intersect that of Earth 's so they pose a collision danger . The United States , European Union , and other nations are currently scanning for NEOs in an effort called Spaceguard .   In the United States and since 1998 , NASA has a congressional mandate to catalogue all NEOs that are at least 1 kilometer wide , as the impact of such an object would be globally catastrophic . In 2006 , it was estimated that 20 % of the mandated objects had not yet been found . In 2011 , largely as a result of NEOWISE , it was estimated that 93 % of the NEAs larger than 1 km had been found and that only about 70 remained to be discovered . , there have been 875 NEAs larger than 1 km discovered , of which 157 are potentially hazardous . The inventory is much less complete for smaller objects , which still have potential for large scale , though not global , damage .   Potentially hazardous objects ( PHOs ) are currently defined based on parameters that measure the object 's potential to make threatening close approaches to the Earth . Mostly objects with an Earth minimum orbit intersection distance ( MOID ) of 0.05 AU or less and an absolute magnitude ( H ) of 22.0 or brighter ( a rough indicator of large size ) are considered PHOs . Objects that can not approach closer to the Earth ( i.e. MOID ) than 0.05 AU , or are smaller than about 150 m ( 500 ft ) in diameter ( i.e. H = 22.0 with assumed albedo of 13 % ) , are not considered PHOs . NASA 's catalog for near-Earth objects also includes the approach distances of asteroids and comets measured in lunar distances , and this usage has become a common unit of measure used by the news media in discussing these objects .   Some NEOs are of special interest because they can be physically explored with lower mission velocity than for even the Moon , due to their combination of low velocity with respect to Earth ( ΔV ) and weak gravity , so they may present interesting scientific opportunities both for direct geochemical and astronomical investigation , and as potentially economical sources of extraterrestrial materials for human exploitation . This makes them an attractive target for exploration . As of 2016 , three near-Earth objects have been visited by spacecraft .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

136019,"In Kentucky, the electric chair has been retired except for a subset of people.",Electric_chair,"Execution by electrocution , performed using an electric chair , is a method of execution originating in the United States in which the condemned person is strapped to a specially built wooden chair and electrocuted through electrodes fastened on the head and leg . This execution method , conceived in 1881 by a Buffalo , New York , dentist named Alfred P. Southwick , was developed throughout the 1880s as a humane alternative to hanging and first used in 1890 . This execution method has been used in the United States and , for a period of several decades , in the Philippines ( its first use there in 1924 , last in 1976 ) .   Historically , once the condemned person was attached to the chair , various cycles ( differing in voltage and duration ) of alternating current would be passed through the individual 's body , in order to cause fatal damage to the internal organs ( including the brain ) . The first more powerful jolt of electric current was designed to pass through the head and cause immediate unconsciousness and brain death . The second less powerful jolt was designed to cause fatal damage to the vital organs . Death may also be caused by electrical overstimulation of the heart .   Although the electric chair has long been a symbol of the death penalty in the United States , its use is in decline due to the rise of lethal injection , which is widely believed to be a more humane method of execution . Although some states still maintain electrocution as a method of execution , today it is only maintained as a secondary method that may be chosen over lethal injection at the request of the prisoner , except in Tennessee where it may be used if the drugs for lethal injection are not available , without input from the prisoner . As of 2014 , electrocution is an optional form of execution in Alabama , Florida , South Carolina and Virginia . They allow the prisoner to choose lethal injection as an alternative method . In the state of Kentucky the electric chair has been retired except for those whose capital crimes were committed prior to March 31 , 1998 , and who choose electrocution ; inmates who do not choose electrocution and inmates who committed their crimes after the designated date are executed by lethal injection . In the state of Tennessee the electric chair is available for use if lethal injection drugs are unavailable , or otherwise if the inmate so chooses if their capital crime was committed before 1999 . The electric chair is an alternate form of execution approved for potential use in Arkansas and Oklahoma if other forms of execution are found unconstitutional in the state at the time of execution . On February 8 , 2008 , the Nebraska Supreme Court determined that execution by electric chair was a `` cruel and unusual punishment '' under the state 's constitution . This brought executions of this type to an end in Nebraska , the only remaining state to retain electrocution as its sole method of execution .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

216790,Timur was Anglo-Saxon.,Turco-Mongol_tradition,"The Turco-Mongol or Turko-Mongol tradition was a cultural synthesis that arose during the early 14th century , among the ruling elites of Mongol Empire successor states such as the Chagatai Khanate and Golden Horde . These elites adopted Turkic languages and different religions such as Buddhism and Islam , while retaining Mongol political and legal institutions . Many later Central Asian states drew heavily on this tradition , including the Timurid Empire , the Kazakh Khanate , the Khanate of Kazan , the Nogai Khanate , the Crimean Khanate , and the Mughal Empire .   A much earlier Turco-Mongol tradition existed in prehistory as well , as evidenced by the extensive lexical borrowings from Proto-Turkic into the ancestor of Proto-Mongolic from around at least the first millennium BCE . Turkic and Mongolic languages share extensive borrowed similarities in their personal pronouns ( e.g. the * b - , * s - , * i - paradigm for 1st , 2nd , and 3rd person , respectively ) , among other lexical similarities of the type , which seem to date to before this era and already existed before the breakup of Turkic around 500 BCE . Turkic and Mongolic peoples shared a common religion , Tengrism , which dates at least from this ancient period .   A still more ancient period of prolonged language contact between Turkic and Mongolic is indicated by further and more fundamental phonotactic , grammatical , and typological similarities ( e.g. synchronic vowel harmony , lack of grammatical gender , extensive agglutination , highly similar phonotactic rules and phonology ) . In the past , such similarities were attributed to a genetic relationship and led to the widespread acceptance of an Altaic language family . More recently , due to the lack of a definitive demonstration of genetic relationship , these similarities have been divided into at these three known periods of language contact . The similarities have led to the proposal of a Northeast Asian sprachbund instead , which also includes the Tungusic , Korean , and Japonic language families , although Turkic and Mongolic display the most extensive similarities .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

She was the mother of King Henry VIII . Therefore , she was the daughter , sister , niece , wife , mother and grandmother of successive Kings of England .   The period of Henry VI 's readaption from October 1470 until April 1471 and the period between her father 's death in 1483 , when she was 17 , and the making of peace between her mother and her uncle Richard were violent and anxious interludes in what was mostly a peaceful life . Her two brothers disappeared , the `` Princes in the Tower '' , their fate unknown . She was welcomed back to court by her Uncle Richard III , along with all of her sisters . As a Yorkist princess , the final victory of the Lancastrian faction in the War of the Roses may have seemed a further disaster , but Henry Tudor knew the importance of Yorkist support for his invasion and promised to marry her before he arrived in England ; this was an important move , which , however , failed to bring him the desired Yorkist support .   Her marriage seems to have been successful , though her eldest son Arthur , Prince of Wales , died at age 15 in 1502 , and three other children died young .

Of the Shrutis ( Vedic corpus ) , the Upanishads alone are widely influential among Hindus , considered scriptures par excellence of Hinduism , and their central ideas have continued to influence its thoughts and traditions .   The Smriti texts are a specific body of Hindu texts attributed to an author , as a derivative work they are considered less authoritative than Sruti in Hinduism . The Smrti literature is a vast corpus of diverse texts , and includes but is not limited to Vedāngas , the Hindu epics , the Sutras and Shastras , the texts of Hindu philosophies , the Puranas , the Kāvya or poetical literature , the Bhasyas , and numerous Nibandhas ( digests ) covering politics , ethics , culture , arts and society .   Many ancient and medieval Hindu texts were composed in Sanskrit , many others in regional Indian languages . In modern times , most ancient texts have been translated into other Indian languages and some in Western languages . Prior to the start of the common era , the Hindu texts were composed orally , then memorized and transmitted orally , from one generation to next , for more than a millennia before they were written down into manuscripts . This verbal tradition of preserving and transmitting Hindu texts , from one generation to next , continued into the modern era .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

The series chronicles the adventures and endeavors of the title character and his various friends in the fictional underwater city of Bikini Bottom . The series ' popularity has made it a media franchise , as well as the highest rated series to ever air on Nickelodeon , and the most distributed property of MTV Networks . As of 2015 , the media franchise has generated $ 12 billion in merchandising revenue for Nickelodeon .   Many of the ideas for the series originated in an unpublished educational comic book titled The Intertidal Zone , which Hillenburg created in 1989 . He began developing SpongeBob SquarePants into a television series in 1996 upon the cancellation of Rocko 's Modern Life , and turned to Tom Kenny , who had worked with him on that series , to voice the title character . SpongeBob was originally going to be named SpongeBoy , and the series was to be called SpongeBoy Ahoy ! , but these were both changed , as the name was already trademarked .   Nickelodeon held a preview for the series in the United States on May 1 , 1999 , following the television airing of the 1999 Kids ' Choice Awards . The series officially premiered on July 17 , 1999 . It has received worldwide critical acclaim since its premiere and gained enormous popularity by its second season .

On October 15 , 2016 , the series began airing its current tenth season , beginning with the episode `` Whirly Brains '' . In May 2017 , the show was announced to be renewed for a 12th season .   The series has won a variety of awards , including six Annie Awards , eight Golden Reel Awards , two Emmy Awards , 12 Kids ' Choice Awards , and two BAFTA Children 's Awards . Despite its widespread popularity , the series has been involved in several public controversies , including one centered on speculation over SpongeBob 's intended sexual orientation , and another focusing on the perceived declining quality of the show 's content since the release of the first film . In 2011 , a newly described species of fungi , Spongiforma squarepantsii , was named after the cartoon 's title character .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ
76050,Hebe was unacquainted with any gods or goddesses.,Ares,"Ares ( -LSB- ˈɛəriːz -RSB- Ἄρης -LSB- árɛːs -RSB- ) is the Greek god of war . He is one of the Twelve Olympians , and the son of Zeus and Hera . In Greek literature , he often represents the physical or violent and untamed aspect of war , in contrast to his sister the armored Athena , whose functions as a goddess of intelligence include military strategy and generalship .   The Greeks were ambivalent toward Ares : although he embodied the physical valor necessary for success in war , he was a dangerous force , `` overwhelming , insatiable in battle , destructive , and man-slaughtering . '' His sons Phobos ( Fear ) and Deimos ( Terror ) and his lover , or sister , Enyo ( Discord ) accompanied him on his war chariot . In the Iliad , his father Zeus tells him that he is the god most hateful to him . An association with Ares endows places and objects with a savage , dangerous , or militarized quality . His value as a war god is placed in doubt : during the Trojan War , Ares was on the losing side , while Athena , often depicted in Greek art as holding Nike ( Victory ) in her hand , favoured the triumphant Greeks .   Ares plays a relatively limited role in Greek mythology as represented in literary narratives , though his numerous love affairs and abundant offspring are often alluded to . When Ares does appear in myths , he typically faces humiliation . He is well known as the lover of Aphrodite , the goddess of love , who was married to Hephaestus , god of craftsmanship . The most famous story related to Ares and Aphrodite shows them exposed to ridicule through the wronged husband 's device .   The counterpart of Ares among the Roman gods is Mars , who as a father of the Roman people was given a more important and dignified place in ancient Roman religion as a guardian deity . During the Hellenization of Latin literature , the myths of Ares were reinterpreted by Roman writers under the name of Mars . Greek writers under Roman rule also recorded cult practices and beliefs pertaining to Mars under the name of Ares . Thus in the classical tradition of later Western art and literature , the mythology of the two figures becomes virtually indistinguishable .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

26341,Pocahontas was born Matoaka.,Pocahontas,"Pocahontas ( born Matoaka , known as Amonute , 1596 -- 1617 ) was a Native American woman notable for her association with the colonial settlement at Jamestown , Virginia . Pocahontas was the daughter of Powhatan , the paramount chief of a network of tributary tribal nations in the Tsenacommacah , encompassing the Tidewater region of Virginia . In a well-known historical anecdote , she is said to have saved the life of a captive of the Native Americans , the Englishman John Smith , in 1607 by placing her head upon his own when her father raised his war club to execute him . Some historians have suggested that this story , as told by Smith , is untrue .   Pocahontas was captured by the English during Anglo-Indian hostilities in 1613 , and held for ransom . During her captivity , she converted to Christianity and took the name Rebecca . When the opportunity arose for her to return to her people , she chose to remain with the English . In April 1614 , she married tobacco planter John Rolfe , and in January 1615 , bore their son , Thomas Rolfe .   In 1616 , the Rolfes traveled to London . Pocahontas was presented to English society as an example of the `` civilized savage '' in hopes of stimulating investment in the Jamestown settlement . She became something of a celebrity , was elegantly fêted , and attended a masque at Whitehall Palace . In 1617 , the Rolfes set sail for Virginia , but Pocahontas died at Gravesend of unknown causes . She was buried in a church in Gravesend in the United Kingdom , but the exact location of her grave is unknown .   Numerous places , landmarks , and products in the United States have been named after Pocahontas . Her story has been romanticized over the years , and she is a subject of art , literature , and film . Many famous people have claimed to be among her descendants through her son Thomas , including members of the First Families of Virginia , First Lady Edith Wilson , American Western actor Glenn Strange , and astronomer Percival Lowell .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

222895,An all-seater stadium is a stadium meant for activity or games.,All-seater_stadium,"An all-seater stadium is a sports stadium in which every spectator has a seat . This is commonplace in association football stadiums in nations such as the United Kingdom , Spain , and the Netherlands . Most association football ( soccer ) , American football stadiums in the United States and Canadian Football League stadiums in Canada are all-seaters , as are most baseball and track and field stadiums in those countries . A stadium that is not an all-seater has areas for attendees holding standing-room only tickets to stand and view the proceedings . Such standing areas were known as terraces in Britain . Stands with only terraces used to dominate the football attendance in the UK . For instance , the South Bank Stand behind the southern goal at Molineux Stadium , Wolverhampton , home of Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. , had a maximum of 32,000 standing attenders , while the rest of the stadium hosted a little bit less than that ( total maximum attendance was around 59,000 ) .   Some European countries , such as Germany , do not have all-seater stadiums . German fans expressed a preference to stand while watching football , so the country 's grounds have large terraced areas . For instance , Borussia Dortmund 's Westfalenstadion ( commercially known as Signal Iduna Park ) has an all-seated capacity of 65,829 , but during Bundesliga games the attendance limit is set to 81,360 . ( If the general rule `` two standing occupies the same space as one sitting '' applies , then around 15,000 seats are replaced by 30,000 standing attenders at Bundesliga games . )",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

It may refer to :   Construction  Designated area where vehicles , supplies , and construction equipment are positioned for access and use to a construction site .   Ecology  Resting and feeding places of migratory birds are referred to as staging areas .   Entertainment  Places designated for setting up parades and other elaborate presentations .   Military  In military usage , a staging area is a place where troops or equipment in transit are assembled or processed .  The US Department of Defense uses these definitions :   Often and historically this military staging area has been termed a point d'appui , which is often on high ground and sometimes coincident with a significant prehistoric monument , as in the case of Catto Long Barrow in Aberdeenshire , Scotland . Unlike normal bases , the facilities of a staging area are temporary , mainly because for a certain time it will hold much more troops and materiel than would be reasonable in peacetime .   Militaries use staging areas to deploy military units , aircraft and warships and materiel ahead of an attack or invasion . In former times , this used to be generally the border area of one 's own country , but in recent wars ( Gulf War , Kosovo War , Iraq War ) it may also be the border area of another unrelated country granting access .   Space exploration  Area where final assembly is done on space vehicles before they are moved out to their launch pad .

22419,Nero has passed away.,Nero,"Nero ( -LSB- ˈnɪəroʊ -RSB- Latin : Nerō Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus ; 15 December 37 AD -- 9 June 68 AD ) was Roman Emperor from 54 to 68 AD , and the last in the Julio-Claudian dynasty . Nero was adopted by his great-uncle Claudius to become his heir and successor , and like him , became emperor with the consent of the praetorian guard . Nero 's mother , Agrippina the Younger , was implicated in Claudius ' death and Nero 's nomination as emperor . She dominated Nero 's early life and decisions until he cast her off ; five years into his reign , he had her murdered .   His reign began well . At first he was content to be guided by his mother , his tutor Lucius Annaeus Seneca and his Praetorian Prefect , Sextus Afranius Burrus . As time passed , he played a more active and independent role in government and foreign policy . During his reign , the redoubtable general Corbulo conducted a successful war and negotiated peace with the Parthian Empire . His general Suetonius Paulinus crushed a major revolt in Britain . The Bosporan Kingdom was briefly annexed to the empire , and the First Jewish -- Roman War began . Nero focused much of his attention on diplomacy , trade and the cultural life of the empire , ordering theatres built and promoting athletic games . He made public appearances as a poet , musician and charioteer ; in the eyes of traditionalists , this undermined the dignity and authority of his person , status and office . His extravagant , empire-wide program of public and private works was funded by a rise in taxes , much resented by the middle and upper classes . Various plots against his life were revealed , and their ringleaders were executed ; most were Nero 's own courtiers .   In 68 , the governor Vindex in Gaul rebelled , with the support of Galba , Governor of Hispania Tarraconensis . Vindex 's revolt failed in its immediate aim but Rome 's discontented civil and military authorities declared for Galba , and chose him as emperor . Nero fled Rome . He committed suicide on June 9 , 68 AD when told that he had been tried in absentia and condemned to death as a public enemy ( The first Roman Emperor to do so ) . His death ended the Julio-Claudian dynasty , sparking a brief period of civil wars known as the Year of the Four Emperors .   Nero 's rule is usually associated with tyranny and extravagance ; his more infamous executions include that of his mother . Most Roman sources , such as Suetonius and Cassius Dio , offer overwhelmingly negative assessments of his personality and reign ; Tacitus claims that the Roman people thought him compulsive and corrupt . Many Romans believed that the great Roman fire of 64 was instigated by Nero to clear the way for his planned palatial complex , the Domus Aurea . He was said to have seized Christians as scapegoats for the fire and burned them alive , seemingly motivated not by public justice but by personal cruelty . Some modern historians question the reliability of the ancient sources on Nero 's tyrannical acts . A few sources paint Nero in a more favourable light . There is evidence of his popularity among the Roman commoners , especially in the eastern provinces of the Empire , where a popular legend arose that Nero had not died and would return . At least three leaders of short-lived , failed rebellions presented themselves as `` Nero reborn '' , to enlist popular support .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

It is the sixth-most populous country with a population exceeding 201 million people . In terms of area , it is the 33rd-largest country spanning 881,913 km2 . Pakistan has a 1,046 km coastline along the Arabian Sea and its Gulf of Oman in the south and is bordered by India to the east , Afghanistan to the west , Iran to the southwest , and China in the far northeast , respectively . It is separated from Tajikistan by Afghanistan 's narrow Wakhan Corridor in the north , and also shares a maritime border with Oman .   The territory that now constitutes Pakistan is considered a cradle of civilisation that was previously home to several ancient cultures , including the Mehrgarh of the Neolithic and the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilisation , and later home to kingdoms ruled by people of different faiths and cultures , including Hindus , Indo-Greeks , Muslims , Turco-Mongols , Afghans , and Sikhs . The area has been ruled by numerous empires and dynasties , including the Persian Achaemenid Empire , Alexander of Macedonia , the Indian Mauryan Empire , the Arab Umayyad Caliphate , the Delhi Sultanate , the Mongol Empire , the Mughal Empire , the Durrani Empire , the Sikh Empire , and most recently , the British Empire .   Pakistan is unique among Muslim countries in that it is the only country to have been created in the name of Islam . As a result of the Pakistan Movement led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah and the subcontinent 's struggle for independence , Pakistan was created in 1947 as an independent homeland for South Asian Muslims . It is an ethnically and linguistically diverse country , with a similarly diverse geography and wildlife . Initially a dominion , Pakistan adopted a constitution in 1956 , becoming an Islamic republic . An ethnic civil war in 1971 resulted in the secession of East Pakistan as the new country of Bangladesh . In 1973 Pakistan adopted a new constitution establishing , alongside its pre-existing parliamentary republic status , a federal government based in Islamabad consisting of four provinces and four federal territories . The new constitution also stipulated that all laws were to conform to the injunctions of Islam as laid down in the Quran and Sunnah .   A regional and middle power , Pakistan has the sixth-largest standing armed forces in the world and is also a nuclear power as well as a declared nuclear-weapons state , being the second in South Asia and the only nation in the Muslim world to have that status . Pakistan has a semi-industrialised economy with a well-integrated agriculture sector , and a growing services sector . The Pakistani economy is the 24th-largest in the world in terms of purchasing power and the 41st-largest in terms of nominal GDP ( World Bank ) . It is ranked among the emerging and growth-leading economies of the world , and is backed by one of the world 's largest and fastest-growing middle classes .   The post-independence history of Pakistan has been characterised by periods of military rule , and since 2008 a transition to democracy , amid conflicts with neighbouring India . The country continues to face challenging problems such as illiteracy , healthcare , and corruption , but has substantially reduced poverty and terrorism and expanded per capita income . Pakistan is a member of the United Nations , the Non-Aligned Movement , the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation , the Commonwealth of Nations , the ECO , the SAARC , the Developing Eight , and the G20 developing nations , Group of 24 , Group of 77 , and ECOSOC .

He was born in the small town of Saint-Gervais-les-Trois-Clochers in the district of Châtellerault , near the city of Loudun . He could be retrospectively classified as a neurologist , but the field did not exist in his time .   During 1873 Tourette began medical studies at Poitiers . He later relocated to Paris where he became a student , amanuensis , and house physician of his mentor , the influential contemporary neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot , director of the Salpêtrière Hospital . Charcot also helped him to advance in his academic career . Tourette studied and lectured in psychotherapy , hysteria and medical and legal ramifications of mesmerism ( modern-day hypnosis ) .   Tourette described the symptoms of Tourette 's syndrome in nine patients in 1884 , using the name `` maladie des tics '' . Charcot renamed the syndrome `` Gilles de la Tourette 's illness '' in his honor .   In 1893 , a former female patient shot Tourette in the head , claiming he had hypnotized her against her will . Both Tourette and many modern hypnologists state that this is impossible . His mentor , Charcot , had died recently , and his young son had also died recently . After these events , Tourette began to experience mood swings between depression and hypomania . Nevertheless , he organized public lectures in which he spoke about literacy , mesmerism and theatre .   Tourette published an article on hysteria in the German Army , which angered Bismarck , and a further article about unhygienic conditions in the floating hospitals on the river Thames . With Gabriel Legué he analyzed abbess Jeanne des Anges ' account of her hysteria that was allegedly based on her unrequited love for a priest Urbain Grandier , who was later burned for witchcraft .   Around 1902 , Tourette 's condition worsened and he was dismissed from his post . Gilles de la Tourette died on 26 May 1904 in a psychiatric hospital in Lausanne , Switzerland .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Founded in 1885 , the Congress led India to independence from Great Britain , and powerfully influenced other anti-colonial nationalist movements in the British Empire . After India 's independence in 1947 , the Congress formed the government at center in most instances , and also many regional state governments . The Congress is a secular , left-of-centre , party . Although it did not fare well in the last general elections in India in 2014 , it remains one of two major , nationwide , political parties in India , along with the right-wing , Hindu nationalist , Bhartiya Janata Party ( BJP ) .   The Congress was the first modern nationalist movement to emerge in the British Empire in Asia and Africa . It was founded in Bombay in late December 1885 , during the British Raj in India . Its principal founders were , Allan Octavian Hume ( a former administrator of Etawah district , North-Western Provinces , and pioneering ornithologist of India ) , as well as William Wedderburn , Pherozeshah Mehta , Dadabhai Naoroji , Dinshaw Wacha , and others . From the late 19th-century , and especially after 1920 , under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi , Congress became the principal leader of the Indian independence movement , with over 15 million members and over 70 million participants .   After independence in 1947 , Congress became India 's dominant political party ; , in the 15 general elections since independence , it has won an outright majority on six occasions and has led the ruling coalition a further four times , heading the central government for 49 years . There have been seven Congress Prime Ministers , the first being Jawaharlal Nehru ( 1947 -- 64 ) , and the most recent Manmohan Singh ( 2004 -- 14 ) . The party 's social liberal platform is generally considered to be on the centre-left of Indian politics .   From 2004 to 2014 , the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance , a coalition of several regional parties , formed the Indian government and was headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh . As of March 2017 , the party is in power in five states : Punjab , Himachal Pradesh , Karnataka , Meghalaya and Mizoram . In Bihar , it is a part of the ruling coalition . The Congress has previously directly ruled Andhra Pradesh , Tamil Nadu , Gujarat , Madhya Pradesh , Rajasthan , Uttar Pradesh and Goa . In the 2014 general election , the Congress had its poorest post-independence general election performance , winning only 44 seats of the 543-member house .   The Congress ' social policy is based upon the Gandhian principle of Sarvodaya -- the lifting up of all sections of society -- which involves the improvement of the lives of economically underprivileged and socially marginalised people . The party primarily endorses social liberalism -- seeking to balance individual liberty and social justice , and secularism -- asserting the right to be free from religious rule and teachings .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

It is the most-used search engine on the World Wide Web , handling more than three billion searches each day . , it is the most used search engine in the US with 64.0 % market share .   The order of search on Google 's search-results pages is based , in part , on a priority rank called a `` PageRank '' . Google Search provides many different options for customized search , using Boolean operators such as exclusion ( '' - xx '' ) , alternatives ( `` xx OR yy OR zz '' ) , and wildcards ( `` Winston * Churchill '' returns `` Winston Churchill '' , `` Winston Spencer Churchill '' , etc. ) . The same and other options can be specified in a different way on an Advanced Search page .   The main purpose of Google Search is to hunt for text in publicly accessible documents offered by web servers , as opposed to other data , such as images or data contained in databases . It was originally developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1997 . Google Search provides several features beyond searching for words . These include synonyms , weather forecasts , time zones , stock quotes , maps , earthquake data , movie showtimes , airports , home listings , and sports scores . There are special features for numbers , dates , and some specific forms , including ranges , prices , temperatures , money and measurement unit conversions , calculations , package tracking , patents , area codes , and language translation . In June 2011 Google introduced `` Google Voice Search '' to search for spoken , rather than typed , words . In May 2012 Google introduced a Knowledge Graph semantic search feature in the U.S.   Analysis of the frequency of search terms may indicate economic , social and health trends . Data about the frequency of use of search terms on Google can be openly inquired via Google Trends and have been shown to correlate with flu outbreaks and unemployment levels , and provide the information faster than traditional reporting methods and surveys . As of mid-2016 , Google 's search engine has begun to rely on these deep neural networks .   In October 2016 , Gary Illyes , a webmaster trends analyst with Google , announced that the search engine will be making a new , primary web index dedicated for mobile , with a secondary , less up-to-date index for desktop use . The change is a response from the continued growth in mobile , and a push for web developers to adopt a mobile-friendly version of their websites . Illyes stated the change will happen in `` months '' .   Competitors of Google include Baidu and Soso.com in China ; Naver.com and Daum.net in South Korea ; Yandex in Russia ; Seznam.cz in the Czech Republic ; Yahoo in Japan , Taiwan and the US , as well as Bing and DuckDuckGo .

It was the flagship product of the Netscape Communications Corp and was the dominant web browser in terms of usage share in the 1990s , but by 2002 its usage had almost disappeared . This was primarily due to the increased usage of Microsoft 's Internet Explorer web browser software , and partly because the Netscape Corporation ( later purchased by AOL ) did not sustain Netscape Navigator 's technical innovation after the late 1990s .   The business demise of Netscape was a central premise of Microsoft 's antitrust trial , wherein the Court ruled that Microsoft Corporation 's bundling of Internet Explorer with the Windows operating system was a monopolistic and illegal business practice . The decision came too late for Netscape , however , as Internet Explorer had by then become the dominant web browser in Windows .   The Netscape Navigator web browser was succeeded by the Netscape Communicator suite in 1997 .

124240,Honeymoon is a collection of music.,Album,"An album is a collection of audio recordings issued as a single item on CD , record , audio tape or another medium . Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century , first as books of individual 78rpm records , then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm . Vinyl LPs are still issued , though in the 21st-century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc ( CD ) and MP3 formats . The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl .   An album may be recorded in a recording studio ( fixed or mobile ) , in a concert venue , at home , in the field , or a mix of places . The time frame for completely recording an album varies between a few hours to several years . This process usually requires several takes with different parts recorded separately , and then brought or `` mixed '' together . Recordings that are done in one take without overdubbing are termed `` live '' , even when done in a studio . Studios are built to absorb sound , eliminating reverberation , so as to assist in mixing different takes ; other locations , such as concert venues and some `` live rooms '' , allow for reverberation , which creates a `` live '' sound . The majority of studio recordings contain an abundance of editing , sound effects , voice adjustments , etc. . With modern recording technology , musicians can be recorded in separate rooms or at separate times while listening to the other parts using headphones ; with each part recorded as a separate track .   Album covers and liner notes are used , and sometimes additional information is provided , such as analysis of the recording , and lyrics or librettos . Historically , the term `` album '' was applied to a collection of various items housed in a book format . In musical usage the word was used for collections of short pieces of printed music from the early nineteenth century . Later , collections of related 78rpm records were bundled in book-like albums ( one side of a 78 rpm record could hold only about 3.5 minutes of sound ) . When long-playing records were introduced , a collection of pieces on a single record was called an album ; the word was extended to other recording media such as compact disc , MiniDisc , Compact audio cassette , and digital albums as they were introduced .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

It is located between Erfurt in the west and Jena in the east , approximately 80 km southwest of Leipzig , 170 km north of Nuremberg and 170 km west of Dresden . Together with the neighbour-cities Erfurt and Jena it forms the central metropolitan area of Thuringia with approximately 500,000 inhabitants , whereas the city itself counts a population of 65,000 . Weimar is well known because of its large cultural heritage and its importance in German history .   The city was a focal point of the German Enlightenment and home of the leading characters of the literary genre of Weimar Classicism , the writers Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller . In the 19th century , famous composers like Franz Liszt made a music centre of Weimar and later , artists and architects like Henry van de Velde , Wassily Kandinsky , Paul Klee , Lyonel Feininger and Walter Gropius came to the city and founded the Bauhaus movement , the most important German design school of the interwar period . However , the political history of 20th-century Weimar was inconsistent : it was the place where Germany 's first democratic constitution was signed after the First World War , giving its name to the Weimar Republic period in German politics ( 1918 -- 33 ) , as well as one of the cities mythologized by the National Socialist propaganda .   Until 1948 , Weimar was the capital of Thuringia . Today , many places in the city centre have been designated as UNESCO World Heritage sites ( either as part of the Weimar Classicism complex or as part of the Bauhaus complex ) and tourism is one of the leading economic sectors of Weimar . Relevant institutions in Weimar are the Bauhaus University , the Liszt School of Music , the Duchess Anna Amalia Library and two leading courts of Thuringia ( Supreme Administrative Court and Constitutional Court ) . In 1999 , Weimar was the European Capital of Culture .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Monosodium glutamate is found naturally in tomatoes , cheese and other foods .   MSG is used in the food industry as a flavor enhancer with an umami taste that intensifies the meaty , savory flavor of food , as naturally occurring glutamate does in foods such as stews and meat soups . It was first prepared in 1908 by Japanese biochemist Kikunae Ikeda , who was trying to isolate and duplicate the savory taste of kombu , an edible seaweed used as a base for many Japanese soups . MSG as a flavor enhancer balances , blends , and rounds the perception of other tastes .   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has given MSG its generally recognized as safe ( GRAS ) designation . A popular belief is that large doses of MSG can cause headaches and other feelings of discomfort , known as `` Chinese restaurant syndrome , '' but double-blind tests fail to find evidence of such a reaction . The European Union classifies it as a food additive permitted in certain foods and subject to quantitative limits .

It is the 4th generation of iPhone , succeeding the 3GS and preceding the 4S .   The iPhone 4 introduced a new hardware design to the iPhone family , which Apple 's CEO Steve Jobs touted as the thinnest smartphone in the world at the time ; it consisted of an uninsulated stainless steel frame which doubles as an antenna , with internal components situated between chemically strengthened aluminosilicate glass . The iPhone 4 also introduced Apple 's new high-resolution `` Retina Display '' ; while maintaining the same physical size and aspect ratio as its precursors , its liquid crystal display had a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch . The iPhone 4 also introduced Apple 's A4 system-on-chip , along with iOS 4 -- which notably introduced multitasking functionality and Apple 's new FaceTime video chat service .

201574,A thunderstorm is a subclass of storm.,Thunderstorm,"A thunderstorm , also known as an electrical storm , lightning storm , or thundershower , is a storm characterized by the presence of lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth 's atmosphere , known as thunder . Thunderstorms occur in association with a type of cloud known as a cumulonimbus . They are usually accompanied by strong winds , heavy rain , and sometimes snow , sleet , hail , or , in contrast , no precipitation at all . Thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband , known as a squall line . Strong or severe thunderstorms , known as supercells , rotate as do cyclones . While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy , vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction .   Thunderstorms result from the rapid upward movement of warm , moist air , sometimes along a front . As the warm , moist air moves upward , it cools , condenses , and forms a cumulonimbus cloud that can reach heights of over 20 km . As the rising air reaches its dew point temperature , water vapor condenses into water droplets or ice , reducing pressure locally within the thunderstorm cell . Any precipitation falls the long distance through the clouds towards the Earth 's surface . As the droplets fall , they collide with other droplets and become larger . The falling droplets create a downdraft as it pulls cold air with it , and this cold air spreads out at the Earth 's surface , occasionally causing strong winds that are commonly associated with thunderstorms .   Thunderstorms can form and develop in any geographic location but most frequently within the mid-latitude , where warm , moist air from tropical latitudes collides with cooler air from polar latitudes . Thunderstorms are responsible for the development and formation of many severe weather phenomena . Thunderstorms , and the phenomena that occur along with them , pose great hazards . Damage that results from thunderstorms is mainly inflicted by downburst winds , large hailstones , and flash flooding caused by heavy precipitation . Stronger thunderstorm cells are capable of producing tornadoes and waterspouts .   There are four types of thunderstorms : single-cell , multi-cell cluster , multi-cell lines , and supercells . Supercell thunderstorms are the strongest and the most associated with severe weather phenomena . Mesoscale convective systems formed by favorable vertical wind shear within the tropics and subtropics can be responsible for the development of hurricanes . Dry thunderstorms , with no precipitation , can cause the outbreak of wildfires from the heat generated from the cloud-to-ground lightning that accompanies them . Several means are used to study thunderstorms : weather radar , weather stations , and video photography . Past civilizations held various myths concerning thunderstorms and their development as late as the 18th century . Beyond the Earth 's atmosphere , thunderstorms have also been observed on the planets of Jupiter , Saturn , Neptune , and , probably , Venus .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines , the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves .   Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines , perhaps the oldest through its inclusion of astronomy . Over the last two millennia , physics was a part of natural philosophy along with chemistry , biology , and certain branches of mathematics , but during the scientific revolution in the 17th century , the natural sciences emerged as unique research programs in their own right . Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research , such as biophysics and quantum chemistry , and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined . New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms of other sciences while opening new avenues of research in areas such as mathematics and philosophy .   Physics also makes significant contributions through advances in new technologies that arise from theoretical breakthroughs . For example , advances in the understanding of electromagnetism or nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products that have dramatically transformed modern-day society , such as television , computers , domestic appliances , and nuclear weapons ; advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization , and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus .

The state is part of both the Southern United States , as well as the Mid-Atlantic . Virginia is nicknamed the `` Old Dominion '' due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America , and `` Mother of Presidents '' because eight U.S. presidents were born there , more than any other state . The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay , which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna . The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond ; Virginia Beach is the most populous city , and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision . The Commonwealth 's estimated population is over 8.3 million .   The area 's history begins with several indigenous groups , including the Powhatan . In 1607 the London Company established the Colony of Virginia as the first permanent New World English colony . Slave labor and the land acquired from displaced Native American tribes each played a significant role in the colony 's early politics and plantation economy . Virginia was one of the 13 Colonies in the American Revolution and joined the Confederacy in the American Civil War , during which Richmond was made the Confederate capital and Virginia 's northwestern counties seceded to form the state of West Virginia . Although the Commonwealth was under one-party rule for nearly a century following Reconstruction , both major national parties are competitive in modern Virginia .   The Virginia General Assembly is the oldest continuous law-making body in the New World . The state government was ranked most effective by the Pew Center on the States in both 2005 and 2008 . It is unique in how it treats cities and counties equally , manages local roads , and prohibits its governors from serving consecutive terms . Virginia 's economy has many sectors : agriculture in the Shenandoah Valley ; federal agencies in Northern Virginia , including the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense and Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) ; and military facilities in Hampton Roads , the site of the region 's main seaport .

216790,Timur was Anglo-Saxon.,Timur,"Timur ( تیمور Temūr , Chagatai : Temür , 9 April 1336 -- 18 February 1405 ) , historically known as Amir Timur and Tamerlane ( تيمور لنگ Temūr ( - i ) Lang , `` Timur the Lame '' ) , was a Turco-Mongol conqueror . As the founder of the Timurid Empire in Persia and Central Asia he became the first ruler in the Timurid dynasty .   Born into the Barlas confederation in Transoxiana on 9 April 1336 , Timur gained control of the western Chagatai Khanate by 1370 . From that base he led military campaigns across Western , South and Central Asia , the Caucasus and southern Russia , and emerged as the most powerful ruler in the Muslim world after defeating the Mamluks of Egypt and Syria , the emerging Ottoman Empire , and the declining Delhi Sultanate . From these conquests he founded the Timurid Empire , but this empire fragmented shortly after his death .   Timur is considered the last of the great nomadic conquerors of the Eurasian Steppe , and his empire set the stage for the rise of the more structured and lasting Gunpowder Empires in the 1500s and 1600s . According to John Joseph Saunders , Timur 's background was Iranized and not steppe nomad .   Timur envisioned the restoration of the Mongol Empire of Genghis Khan ( died 1227 ) . `` In his formal correspondence Temur continued throughout his life to portray himself as the restorer of Chinggisid rights . He justified his Iranian , Mamluk , and Ottoman campaigns as a re-imposition of legitimate Mongol control over lands taken by usurpers . To legitimize his conquests , Timur relied on Islamic symbols and language , referred to himself as the `` Sword of Islam '' , and patronized educational and religious institutions . He converted nearly all the Borjigin leaders to Islam during his lifetime .  `` Temur , a non-Chinggisid , tried to build a double legitimacy based on his role as both guardian and restorer of the Mongol Empire . ''  Timur also decisively defeated the Christian Knights Hospitaller at the Siege of Smyrna , styling himself a ghazi . By the end of his reign , Timur had gained complete control over all the remnants of the Chagatai Khanate , the Ilkhanate , and the Golden Horde , and even attempted to restore the Yuan dynasty in China .   Timur 's armies were inclusively multi-ethnic and were feared throughout Asia , Africa , and Europe , sizable parts of which his campaigns laid to waste . Scholars estimate that his military campaigns caused the deaths of 17 million people , amounting to about 5 % of the world population at the time .   He was the grandfather of the renowned Timurid sultan , astronomer and mathematician Ulugh Beg , who ruled Central Asia from 1411 to 1449 , and the great-great-great-grandfather of Babur ( 1483-1530 ) , founder of the Mughal Empire , which ruled parts of South Asia for over three centuries , from 1526 until 1857 .  Timur is also recognized as a great patron of art and architecture , as he interacted with Muslim intellectuals such as Ibn Khaldun and Hafiz-i Abru .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

7761,Yin and yang show a balance between opposites.,Yin_and_yang,"In Chinese philosophy , yin and yang ( also yin -- yang or yin yang , yīnyáng `` dark -- bright '' ) describe how seemingly opposite or contrary forces may actually be complementary , interconnected , and interdependent in the natural world , and how they may give rise to each other as they interrelate to one another . Many tangible dualities ( such as light and dark , fire and water , expanding and contracting ) are thought of as physical manifestations of the duality symbolized by yin and yang . This duality lies at the origins of many branches of classical Chinese science and philosophy , as well as being a primary guideline of traditional Chinese medicine , and a central principle of different forms of Chinese martial arts and exercise , such as baguazhang , taijiquan ( t ` ai chi ) , and qigong ( Chi Kung ) , as well as appearing in the pages of the I Ching .   Duality is found in many belief systems , but Yin and Yang are parts of a Oneness that is also equated with the Tao . A term has been coined dualistic-monism or dialectical monism . Yin and yang can be thought of as complementary ( rather than opposing ) forces that interact to form a dynamic system in which the whole is greater than the assembled parts . Everything has both yin and yang aspects ( for instance , shadow can not exist without light ) . Either of the two major aspects may manifest more strongly in a particular object , depending on the criterion of the observation . The yin yang ( i.e. taijitu symbol ) shows a balance between two opposites with a portion of the opposite element in each section .   In Taoist metaphysics , distinctions between good and bad , along with other dichotomous moral judgments , are perceptual , not real ; so , the duality of yin and yang is an indivisible whole . In the ethics of Confucianism on the other hand , most notably in the philosophy of Dong Zhongshu ( 2nd century BC ) , a moral dimension is attached to the idea of yin and yang .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Sweden consequently has a low population density of 22 PD/km2 , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country . Approximately 85 % of the population lives in urban areas .   Germanic peoples have inhabited Sweden since prehistoric times , emerging into history as the Geats/G ötar and Swedes/Svear and constituting the sea peoples known as the Norsemen . Southern Sweden is predominantly agricultural , while the north is heavily forested . Sweden is part of the geographical area of Fennoscandia . The climate is in general very mild for its northerly latitude due to significant maritime influence , that in spite of this still retains warm continental summers .

Swedish territories outside the Scandinavian Peninsula were gradually lost during the 18th and 19th centuries , ending with the annexation of present-day Finland by Russia in 1809 . The last war in which Sweden was directly involved was in 1814 , when Norway was militarily forced into personal union . Since then , Sweden has been at peace , maintaining an official policy of neutrality in foreign affairs . The union with Norway was peacefully dissolved in 1905 , leading to Sweden 's current borders . Though Sweden was formally neutral through both world wars , Sweden engaged in humanitarian efforts , such as taking in refugees from German-occupied Europe .   After the end of the Cold War , Sweden joined the European Union on 1 January 1995 , but declined NATO membership , as well as Eurozone membership following a referendum .

Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with its neighbor Chile to the west , the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north , Brazil to the northeast , Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east , and the Drake Passage to the south . With a mainland area of 2780400 km2 , Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world , the second largest in Latin America , and the largest Spanish-speaking one . The country is subdivided into twenty-three provinces ( provincias , singular provincia ) and one autonomous city ( ciudad autónoma ) , Buenos Aires , which is the federal capital of the nation ( -LSB- Capital Federal , links = no -RSB- ) as decided by Congress .

The earliest recorded human presence in the area of modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period .

Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata , a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776 .

The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability , with massive waves of European immigration radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook . The almost-unparalleled increase in prosperity led to Argentina becoming the seventh wealthiest developed nation in the world by the early 20th century .   After 1930 , Argentina descended into political instability and periodic economic crises that pushed it back into underdevelopment , though it nevertheless remained among the fifteen richest countries until the mid-20th century . Argentina retains its historic status as a middle power in international affairs , and is a prominent regional power in the Southern Cone and Latin America . Argentina has the second largest economy in South America , the third-largest in Latin America and is a member of the G-15 and G-20 major economies .

The dodo 's appearance in life is evidenced only by drawings , paintings , and written accounts from the 17th century . Because these vary considerably , and because only some illustrations are known to have been drawn from live specimens , its exact appearance in life remains unresolved , and little is known about its behaviour . Though the dodo has historically been considered fat and clumsy , it is now thought to have been well-adapted for its ecosystem . It has been depicted with brownish-grey plumage , yellow feet , a tuft of tail feathers , a grey , naked head , and a black , yellow , and green beak . It used gizzard stones to help digest its food , which is thought to have included fruits , and its main habitat is believed to have been the woods in the drier coastal areas of Mauritius . One account states its clutch consisted of a single egg . It is presumed that the dodo became flightless because of the ready availability of abundant food sources and a relative absence of predators on Mauritius .   The first recorded mention of the dodo was by Dutch sailors in 1598 . In the following years , the bird was hunted by sailors and invasive species , while its habitat was being destroyed . The last widely accepted sighting of a dodo was in 1662 . Its extinction was not immediately noticed , and some considered it to be a mythical creature . In the 19th century , research was conducted on a small quantity of remains of four specimens that had been brought to Europe in the early 17th century . Among these is a dried head , the only soft tissue of the dodo that remains today . Since then , a large amount of subfossil material has been collected on Mauritius , mostly from the Mare aux Songes swamp . The extinction of the dodo within less than a century of its discovery called attention to the previously unrecognised problem of human involvement in the disappearance of entire species . The dodo achieved widespread recognition from its role in the story of Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland , and it has since become a fixture in popular culture , often as a symbol of extinction and obsolescence .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Visual Effects in 2001 , but lost to Gladiator .   The film is Verhoeven 's most recent American production . In 2013 , Verhoeven remarked to The Hollywood Reporter : `` I decided after Hollow Man , this is a movie , the first movie that I made that I thought I should not have made . It made money and this and that , but it really is not me anymore . I think many other people could have done that . I do n't think many people could have made RoboCop that way , or either Starship Troopers . But Hollow Man , I thought there might have been 20 directors in Hollywood who could have done that . I felt depressed with myself after 2002 . '' It partly contributed in his return to the Netherlands , his home country , where he made Black Book in 2006 , which was considered a return to form .

205099,Gaius Julius Caesar never participated in politics.,Roman_Senate,"The Roman Senate ( Senatus Romanus Senato Romano ) was a political institution in ancient Rome . It was one of the most enduring institutions in Roman history , being established in the first days of the city ( traditionally founded in 753 BC ) . It survived the overthrow of the kings in 509 BC , the fall of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC , the division of the Roman Empire in 395 AD , the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD , and the barbarian rule of Rome in the 5th , 6th , and 7th centuries .   During the days of the kingdom , it was little more than an advisory council to the king . The last king of Rome , Lucius Tarquinius Superbus , was overthrown following a coup d'état led by Lucius Junius Brutus , who founded the Republic .   During the early Republic , the Senate was politically weak , while the executive magistrates were quite powerful . Since the transition from monarchy to constitutional rule was most likely gradual , it took several generations before the Senate was able to assert itself over the executive magistrates . By the middle Republic , the Senate had reached the apex of its republican power . The late Republic saw a decline in the Senate 's power , which began following the reforms of the tribunes Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus .   After the transition of the Republic into the Principate , the Senate lost much of its political power as well as its prestige . Following the constitutional reforms of the Emperor Diocletian , the Senate became politically irrelevant , and never regained the power that it had once held . When the seat of government was transferred out of Rome , the Senate was reduced to a municipal body . This decline in status was reinforced when the emperor Constantine the Great created an additional senate in Constantinople .   After the Western Roman Empire fell in 476 , the Senate in the West functioned for a time under barbarian rule before being restored after the reconquest of much of the Western Roman Empire 's territories during the reign of Justinian I . The Senate in Rome ultimately disappeared at some point after AD 603 ( the year in which the last known senator was mentioned ) , although the title `` senator '' was still used well into the Middle Ages as a largely meaningless honorific . However , the Eastern Senate survived in Constantinople , until the ancient institution finally vanished there c. 14th century .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

It is the 4th generation of iPhone , succeeding the 3GS and preceding the 4S .   The iPhone 4 introduced a new hardware design to the iPhone family , which Apple 's CEO Steve Jobs touted as the thinnest smartphone in the world at the time ; it consisted of an uninsulated stainless steel frame which doubles as an antenna , with internal components situated between chemically strengthened aluminosilicate glass . The iPhone 4 also introduced Apple 's new high-resolution `` Retina Display '' ; while maintaining the same physical size and aspect ratio as its precursors , its liquid crystal display had a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch . The iPhone 4 also introduced Apple 's A4 system-on-chip , along with iOS 4 -- which notably introduced multitasking functionality and Apple 's new FaceTime video chat service . The iPhone 4 was also the first iPhone to include a front-facing camera , and the first to be released in a version for CDMA networks , ending AT&T 's period as the exclusive carrier of iPhone products in the United States .   It was succeeded as Apple 's flagship smartphone in 2011 by the iPhone 4S . However , iPhone 4 continued to be produced until 2013 .   The iPhone 4 received generally positive reception , with critics praising its revamped design and more powerful hardware in comparison to previous models . While it was a market success , with over 600,000 pre-orders within 24 hours , the release of the iPhone 4 was plagued by highly publicized reports that abnormalities in its new antenna design caused the device to lose its cellular signal if held in a certain way . Most human contact with the phone 's outer edge would cause a significant decrease in signal strength .   The iPhone 4 spent the longest time as Apple 's flagship iPhone model at fifteen months , and had the longest lifespan of any iPhone ever produced , spanning close to four years and available in some developing countries until early 2015 .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

150040,Elizabeth I was the aunt of Henry VIII.,Elizabeth_I_of_England,"Elizabeth I ( 7 September 1533 -- 24 March 1603 ) was Queen of England and Ireland from 17 November 1558 until her death . Sometimes called The Virgin Queen , Gloriana or Good Queen Bess , the childless Elizabeth was the last monarch of the Tudor dynasty .   Elizabeth was the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn , his second wife , who was executed two-and-a-half years after Elizabeth 's birth . Anne 's marriage to Henry VIII was annulled , and Elizabeth was declared illegitimate . Her half-brother , Edward VI , ruled until his death in 1553 , bequeathing the crown to Lady Jane Grey and ignoring the claims of his two half-sisters , Elizabeth and the Roman Catholic Mary , in spite of statute law to the contrary . Edward 's will was set aside and Mary became queen , deposing Lady Jane Grey . During Mary 's reign , Elizabeth was imprisoned for nearly a year on suspicion of supporting Protestant rebels .   In 1558 , Elizabeth succeeded her half-sister to the throne and set out to rule by good counsel . She depended heavily on a group of trusted advisers , led by William Cecil , 1st Baron Burghley . One of her first actions as queen was the establishment of an English Protestant church , of which she became the Supreme Governor . This Elizabethan Religious Settlement was to evolve into the Church of England . It was expected that Elizabeth would marry and produce an heir to continue the Tudor line . She never did , despite numerous courtships . As she grew older , Elizabeth became famous for her virginity . A cult grew around her which was celebrated in the portraits , pageants , and literature of the day .   In government , Elizabeth was more moderate than her father and half-siblings had been . One of her mottoes was `` video et taceo '' ( `` I see but say nothing '' ) . In religion , she was relatively tolerant and avoided systematic persecution . After the pope declared her illegitimate in 1570 and released her subjects from obedience to her , several conspiracies threatened her life , all of which were defeated with the help of her ministers ' secret service . Elizabeth was cautious in foreign affairs , manoeuvring between the major powers of France and Spain . She only half-heartedly supported a number of ineffective , poorly resourced military campaigns in the Netherlands , France , and Ireland . By the mid-1580s , England could no longer avoid war with Spain . England 's defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 associated Elizabeth with one of the greatest military victories in English history .   Elizabeth 's reign is known as the Elizabethan era . The period is famous for the flourishing of English drama , led by playwrights such as William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe , and for the seafaring prowess of English adventurers such as Francis Drake . Some historians depict Elizabeth as a short-tempered , sometimes indecisive ruler , who enjoyed more than her share of luck . Towards the end of her reign , a series of economic and military problems weakened her popularity . Elizabeth is acknowledged as a charismatic performer and a dogged survivor in an era when government was ramshackle and limited , and when monarchs in neighbouring countries faced internal problems that jeopardised their thrones . Such was the case with Elizabeth 's rival , Mary , Queen of Scots , whom she imprisoned in 1568 and had executed in 1587 . After the short reigns of Elizabeth 's half-siblings , her 44 years on the throne provided welcome stability for the kingdom and helped forge a sense of national identity .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

195943,The Hyksos' least important deity was Baal.,Hyksos,"The Hyksos ( -LSB- ˈhɪksɒs -RSB- or -LSB- ˈhɪksoʊz -RSB- Egyptian heqa khaseshet , `` ruler ( s ) of the foreign countries '' ; Ὑκσώς , Ὑξώς ) were a people of mixed origins from Western Asia , who settled in the eastern Nile Delta , some time before 1650 BC . The arrival of the Hyksos led to the end of the Thirteenth Dynasty of Egypt and initiated the Second Intermediate Period of Egypt . In the context of Ancient Egypt , the term `` Asiatic '' -- which is often used for the Hyksos -- may refer to any people native to areas east of Egypt .   Immigration by Canaanite populations preceded the Hyksos . Canaanites first appeared in Egypt towards the end of the 12th Dynasty c. 1800 BC , and either around that time or c. 1720 BC , established an independent realm in the eastern Nile Delta . The Canaanite rulers of the Delta , regrouped in the Fourteenth Dynasty , coexisted with the Egyptian Thirteenth Dynasty , based in Itjtawy . The power of the 13th and 14th Dynasties progressively waned , perhaps due to famine and plague .   In about 1650 BC , both dynasties were invaded by the Hyksos , who formed the Fifteenth Dynasty . The collapse of the Thirteenth Dynasty created a power vacuum in the south , which may have led to the rise of the Sixteenth Dynasty , based in Thebes , and possibly of a local Abydos Dynasty . The Hyksos eventually conquered both , albeit for only a short time in the case of Thebes . From then on , the 17th Dynasty took control of Thebes and reigned for some time in peaceful coexistence with the Hyksos kings , perhaps as their vassals . Eventually , Seqenenre Tao , Kamose and Ahmose waged war against the Hyksos and expelled Khamudi , their last king , from Egypt c. 1550 BC .   The Hyksos practiced horse burials , and their chief deity , their native storm god , Baal , became associated with the Egyptian storm and desert god , Set . The Hyksos were a people of mixed Asiatic origin with mainly Semitic-speaking components . Although some scholars have suggested that the Hyksos contained a Hurrian component , most other scholars have dismissed this possibility . The Hurrians spoke an isolated language , but were under Indo-European rule and influence , and Hurrian etymologies have been suggested for some Hyksos names while Indo-European etymologies have been suggested for a very few names . If a Hurrian component did indeed exist among the Hyksos , an Indo-European component becomes difficult to explain , as Indo-European peoples only exercised a significant influence upon Hurrians in Syria after the Hyksos were well established in Egypt .   The Hyksos brought several technical innovations to Egypt , as well as cultural infusions such as new musical instruments and foreign loanwords . The changes introduced include new techniques of bronze working and pottery , new breeds of animals , and new crops . In warfare , they introduced the horse and chariot , the composite bow , improved battle axes , and advanced fortification techniques . Because of these cultural advances , Hyksos rule became decisive for Egypt 's later empire in the Middle East .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

216780,Timur participated in the Siege of Smyrna.,Timur,"Timur ( تیمور Temūr , Chagatai : Temür , 9 April 1336 -- 18 February 1405 ) , historically known as Amir Timur and Tamerlane ( تيمور لنگ Temūr ( - i ) Lang , `` Timur the Lame '' ) , was a Turco-Mongol conqueror . As the founder of the Timurid Empire in Persia and Central Asia he became the first ruler in the Timurid dynasty .   Born into the Barlas confederation in Transoxiana on 9 April 1336 , Timur gained control of the western Chagatai Khanate by 1370 . From that base he led military campaigns across Western , South and Central Asia , the Caucasus and southern Russia , and emerged as the most powerful ruler in the Muslim world after defeating the Mamluks of Egypt and Syria , the emerging Ottoman Empire , and the declining Delhi Sultanate . From these conquests he founded the Timurid Empire , but this empire fragmented shortly after his death .   Timur is considered the last of the great nomadic conquerors of the Eurasian Steppe , and his empire set the stage for the rise of the more structured and lasting Gunpowder Empires in the 1500s and 1600s . According to John Joseph Saunders , Timur 's background was Iranized and not steppe nomad .   Timur envisioned the restoration of the Mongol Empire of Genghis Khan ( died 1227 ) . `` In his formal correspondence Temur continued throughout his life to portray himself as the restorer of Chinggisid rights . He justified his Iranian , Mamluk , and Ottoman campaigns as a re-imposition of legitimate Mongol control over lands taken by usurpers . To legitimize his conquests , Timur relied on Islamic symbols and language , referred to himself as the `` Sword of Islam '' , and patronized educational and religious institutions . He converted nearly all the Borjigin leaders to Islam during his lifetime .  `` Temur , a non-Chinggisid , tried to build a double legitimacy based on his role as both guardian and restorer of the Mongol Empire . ''  Timur also decisively defeated the Christian Knights Hospitaller at the Siege of Smyrna , styling himself a ghazi . By the end of his reign , Timur had gained complete control over all the remnants of the Chagatai Khanate , the Ilkhanate , and the Golden Horde , and even attempted to restore the Yuan dynasty in China .   Timur 's armies were inclusively multi-ethnic and were feared throughout Asia , Africa , and Europe , sizable parts of which his campaigns laid to waste . Scholars estimate that his military campaigns caused the deaths of 17 million people , amounting to about 5 % of the world population at the time .   He was the grandfather of the renowned Timurid sultan , astronomer and mathematician Ulugh Beg , who ruled Central Asia from 1411 to 1449 , and the great-great-great-grandfather of Babur ( 1483-1530 ) , founder of the Mughal Empire , which ruled parts of South Asia for over three centuries , from 1526 until 1857 .  Timur is also recognized as a great patron of art and architecture , as he interacted with Muslim intellectuals such as Ibn Khaldun and Hafiz-i Abru .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ
201583,A thunderstorm can only be called a thunderstorm.,Thunderstorm,"A thunderstorm , also known as an electrical storm , lightning storm , or thundershower , is a storm characterized by the presence of lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth 's atmosphere , known as thunder . Thunderstorms occur in association with a type of cloud known as a cumulonimbus . They are usually accompanied by strong winds , heavy rain , and sometimes snow , sleet , hail , or , in contrast , no precipitation at all . Thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband , known as a squall line . Strong or severe thunderstorms , known as supercells , rotate as do cyclones . While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy , vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction .   Thunderstorms result from the rapid upward movement of warm , moist air , sometimes along a front . As the warm , moist air moves upward , it cools , condenses , and forms a cumulonimbus cloud that can reach heights of over 20 km . As the rising air reaches its dew point temperature , water vapor condenses into water droplets or ice , reducing pressure locally within the thunderstorm cell . Any precipitation falls the long distance through the clouds towards the Earth 's surface . As the droplets fall , they collide with other droplets and become larger . The falling droplets create a downdraft as it pulls cold air with it , and this cold air spreads out at the Earth 's surface , occasionally causing strong winds that are commonly associated with thunderstorms .   Thunderstorms can form and develop in any geographic location but most frequently within the mid-latitude , where warm , moist air from tropical latitudes collides with cooler air from polar latitudes . Thunderstorms are responsible for the development and formation of many severe weather phenomena . Thunderstorms , and the phenomena that occur along with them , pose great hazards . Damage that results from thunderstorms is mainly inflicted by downburst winds , large hailstones , and flash flooding caused by heavy precipitation . Stronger thunderstorm cells are capable of producing tornadoes and waterspouts .   There are four types of thunderstorms : single-cell , multi-cell cluster , multi-cell lines , and supercells . Supercell thunderstorms are the strongest and the most associated with severe weather phenomena . Mesoscale convective systems formed by favorable vertical wind shear within the tropics and subtropics can be responsible for the development of hurricanes . Dry thunderstorms , with no precipitation , can cause the outbreak of wildfires from the heat generated from the cloud-to-ground lightning that accompanies them . Several means are used to study thunderstorms : weather radar , weather stations , and video photography . Past civilizations held various myths concerning thunderstorms and their development as late as the 18th century . Beyond the Earth 's atmosphere , thunderstorms have also been observed on the planets of Jupiter , Saturn , Neptune , and , probably , Venus .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Edward was a World War II United States Navy veteran and former police officer who became a self-taught and self-professed demonologist , author , and lecturer . Lorraine professes to be clairvoyant and a light trance medium who worked closely with her husband .   In 1952 , the Warrens founded the New England Society for Psychic Research , the oldest ghost hunting group in New England . They authored numerous books about the paranormal and about their private investigations into various reports of paranormal activity . They claimed to have investigated over 10,000 cases during their career . The Warrens were among the very first investigators in the controversial Amityville haunting . According to the Warrens , the N.E.S.P.R. utilizes a variety of individuals , including medical doctors , researchers , police officers , nurses , college students , and members of the clergy in its investigations .

224139,Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew was a scripted TV drama.,Reality_television,"Reality television is a genre of television programming that documents supposedly unscripted real-life situations , and often features an otherwise unknown cast of individuals who are typically not professional actors , although in some shows celebrities may participate . It differs from documentary television in that the focus tends to be on drama , personal conflict , and entertainment rather than educating viewers . The genre has various standard tropes , including `` confessionals '' ( also called talking heads or interview segments ) used by cast members to express their thoughts , which often double as the shows ' narration . In competition-based reality shows , a notable subset , there are other common elements such as one participant being eliminated per episode , a panel of judges , and the concept of `` immunity from elimination . ''   An early example of the genre was the 1991 Dutch series Nummer 28 , which was the first show to bring together strangers and record their interactions . It then exploded as a phenomenon in the late 1990s and early 2000s with the global success of the series Survivor , Idols , and Big Brother . These shows and a number of others ( usually also competition-based ) became global franchises , spawning local versions in dozens of countries . Reality television as a whole has become a fixture of television programming . In the United States , various channels have retooled themselves to focus on reality programs , most famously MTV , which began in 1981 as a music video pioneer , before switching to a nearly all-reality format in the early 2000s .   There are grey areas around what is classified as reality television . Documentaries , television news , sports television , talk shows , and traditional game shows are not classified as reality television , even though they contain elements of the genre , such as unscripted situations and sometimes unknown participants . Other genres that predate the reality television boom have sometimes been retroactively grouped into reality TV , including hidden camera shows such as Candid Camera ( 1948 ) , talent-search shows such as The Original Amateur Hour ( 1948 ) , documentary series about ordinary people such as the Up Series ( 1964 ) , high-concept game shows such as The Dating Game ( 1965 ) , home improvement shows such as This Old House ( 1979 ) , and court shows featuring real-life cases such as The People 's Court ( 1981 ) .   Reality television has faced significant criticism since its rise in popularity . Much of the criticism has centered on the use of the word `` reality '' , and such shows ' attempt to present themselves as a straightforward recounting of events that have occurred . Critics have argued that reality television shows do not accurately reflect reality , in ways both implicit ( participants being placed in artificial situations ) , and deceptive or even fraudulent , such as misleading editing , participants being coached in what to say or how to behave , storylines generated ahead of time , and scenes being staged or re-staged for the cameras . Other criticisms of reality television shows include that they are intended to humiliate or exploit participants ( particularly on competition shows ) ; that they make stars out of either untalented people unworthy of fame , infamous personalities , or both ; and that they glamorize vulgarity and materialism .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

There are also minor Danish-speaking communities in Norway , Sweden , Spain , the United States , Canada , Brazil and Argentina . Due to immigration and language shift in urban areas , around 15 -- 20 % of the population of Greenland speak Danish as their home language .   Along with the other North Germanic languages , Danish is a descendant of Old Norse , the common language of the Germanic peoples that lived in Scandinavia during the Viking Era . Danish , together with Swedish , derives from the East Norse dialect group , while the Middle Norwegian language before the influence of Danish and Norwegian Bokmål are classified as West Norse along with Faroese and Icelandic . A more recent classification based on mutual intelligibility separates modern spoken Danish , Norwegian and Swedish as Mainland Scandinavian while Icelandic and Faroese are classified as Insular Scandinavian .   Until the 16th century , Danish was a continuum of dialects spoken from Schleswig to Scania with no standard variety or spelling conventions . With the Protestant Reformation and the introduction of printing , a standard language was developed which was based on the educated Copenhagen dialect . It spread through use in the education system and administration though German and Latin continued to be the most important written languages well into the 17th century . Following the loss of territory to Germany and Sweden , a nationalist movement adopted the language as a token of Danish identity , and the language experienced a strong surge in use and popularity with major works of literature produced in the 18th and 19th centuries . Today , traditional Danish dialects have all but disappeared , though there are regional variants of the standard language . The main differences in language are between generations , with youth language being particularly innovative .   Danish has a very large vowel inventory comprising 27 phonemically distinctive vowels , and its prosody is characterized by the distinctive phenomenon stød , a kind of laryngeal phonation type . Due to the many pronunciation differences that set apart Danish from its neighboring languages , particularly the vowels , difficult prosody and `` weakly '' pronounced consonants , it is sometimes considered to be a difficult language to learn and understand , and there is some evidence that small children are slower to acquire the phonological distinctions of Danish . The grammar is moderately inflective with strong ( irregular ) and weak ( regular ) conjugations and inflections . Nouns and demonstrative pronouns distinguish common and neutral gender . As in English , Danish only has remnants of a former case system , particularly in the pronouns , and it has lost all person marking on verbs . Its syntax is V2 , with the finite verb always occupying the second slot in the sentence .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

He was a direct descendant of Turco-Mongol conqueror Timur ( Tamurlane ) from the Barlas clan , through his father , and also a descendant of Genghis Khan through his mother . He was also influenced by the Persian culture and this affected both his own actions and those of his successors , giving rise to a significant expansion of the Persianate ethos in the Indian subcontinent .   Babur was the eldest son of Umar Sheikh Mirza . He ascended the throne of Fergana in 1495 at the age of twelve and faced rebellion from his own relatives . He conquered Samarkand two years later , only to lose the city of Fergana soon after . In his attempt to reconquer Fergana , he lost control of Samarkand . In 1501 , his attempt to recapture both cities went in vain as he was defeated by Muhammad Shaybani Khan . In 1504 , he conquered Kabul , which was under the rule of the infant heir of Ulugh Begh . Babur formed a partnership with Safavid ruler Ismail I and reconquered parts of central Asia , including Samarkand , only to again lose it and the other newly conquered lands to the Uzbeks .   After losing Samarkand for the third time , Babur turned his attention to creating his empire in north India . At that time , the Indo-Gangetic Plain of the northern Indian Subcontinent was ruled by Ibrahim Lodi of the Afghan Lodi dynasty , whereas Rajputana was ruled by a Hindu Rajput Confederacy , led by Rana Sanga of Mewar . In 1524 , Daulat Khan Lodi , a rebel of the Lodhi dynasty , invited Babur to overthrow Ibrahim and become ruler . Babur defeated Ibrahim Lodi at the First Battle of Panipat in 1526 and founded the Mughal empire . However , he again faced opposition , this time from Rana Sanga of Mewar who considered Babur a foreigner . The Rana was defeated at the Battle of Khanwa .   Babur married several times . Notable among his sons are Humayun , Kamran Mirza and Hindal Mirza . Babur died in 1530 and was succeeded by Humayun . According to Babur 's wishes , he was buried in Bagh-e-Babur in Kabul , Afghanistan . Being a patrilineal descendant of Timur , Babur considered himself a Timurid and Turk , though Uzbek sources claim him as an ethnic Uzbek . He is considered a national hero in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan . Many of his poems also have become popular folk songs . He wrote his autobiography , Baburnama , in Chaghatai Turkic and this was translated into Persian during Akbar 's reign .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

216795,Timur styled himself as anything but a ghazi.,Timur,"Timur ( تیمور Temūr , Chagatai : Temür , 9 April 1336 -- 18 February 1405 ) , historically known as Amir Timur and Tamerlane ( تيمور لنگ Temūr ( - i ) Lang , `` Timur the Lame '' ) , was a Turco-Mongol conqueror . As the founder of the Timurid Empire in Persia and Central Asia he became the first ruler in the Timurid dynasty .   Born into the Barlas confederation in Transoxiana on 9 April 1336 , Timur gained control of the western Chagatai Khanate by 1370 . From that base he led military campaigns across Western , South and Central Asia , the Caucasus and southern Russia , and emerged as the most powerful ruler in the Muslim world after defeating the Mamluks of Egypt and Syria , the emerging Ottoman Empire , and the declining Delhi Sultanate . From these conquests he founded the Timurid Empire , but this empire fragmented shortly after his death .   Timur is considered the last of the great nomadic conquerors of the Eurasian Steppe , and his empire set the stage for the rise of the more structured and lasting Gunpowder Empires in the 1500s and 1600s . According to John Joseph Saunders , Timur 's background was Iranized and not steppe nomad .   Timur envisioned the restoration of the Mongol Empire of Genghis Khan ( died 1227 ) . `` In his formal correspondence Temur continued throughout his life to portray himself as the restorer of Chinggisid rights . He justified his Iranian , Mamluk , and Ottoman campaigns as a re-imposition of legitimate Mongol control over lands taken by usurpers . To legitimize his conquests , Timur relied on Islamic symbols and language , referred to himself as the `` Sword of Islam '' , and patronized educational and religious institutions . He converted nearly all the Borjigin leaders to Islam during his lifetime .  `` Temur , a non-Chinggisid , tried to build a double legitimacy based on his role as both guardian and restorer of the Mongol Empire . ''  Timur also decisively defeated the Christian Knights Hospitaller at the Siege of Smyrna , styling himself a ghazi . By the end of his reign , Timur had gained complete control over all the remnants of the Chagatai Khanate , the Ilkhanate , and the Golden Horde , and even attempted to restore the Yuan dynasty in China .   Timur 's armies were inclusively multi-ethnic and were feared throughout Asia , Africa , and Europe , sizable parts of which his campaigns laid to waste . Scholars estimate that his military campaigns caused the deaths of 17 million people , amounting to about 5 % of the world population at the time .   He was the grandfather of the renowned Timurid sultan , astronomer and mathematician Ulugh Beg , who ruled Central Asia from 1411 to 1449 , and the great-great-great-grandfather of Babur ( 1483-1530 ) , founder of the Mughal Empire , which ruled parts of South Asia for over three centuries , from 1526 until 1857 .  Timur is also recognized as a great patron of art and architecture , as he interacted with Muslim intellectuals such as Ibn Khaldun and Hafiz-i Abru .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ
126705,The 2003 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament featured the top tier of intercollegiate players.,NCAA_Division_I,"Division I ( D-I ) is the highest level of intercollegiate athletics sanctioned by the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) in the United States . D-I schools include the major collegiate athletic powers , with larger budgets , more elaborate facilities and more athletic scholarships than Divisions II and III as well as many smaller schools committed to the highest level of intercollegiate competition .   This level was once called the University Division of the NCAA , in contrast to the lower level College Division ; these terms were replaced with numeric divisions in 1973 . The University Division was renamed Division I , while the College Division was split in two ; the College Division members that offered scholarships or wanted to compete against those who did became Division II , while those who did not want to offer scholarships became Division III .   For football only , Division I was further subdivided in 1978 into Division I-A ( the principal football schools ) , Division I-AA ( the other schools with football teams ) , and Division I ( those schools not sponsoring football ) . In 2006 , Division I-A and I-AA were renamed `` Football Bowl Subdivision '' ( FBS ) and `` Football Championship Subdivision '' ( FCS ) , respectively . FBS teams are allowed a maximum of 85 players receiving athletically-based aid per year , with each player allowed to receive up to a full scholarship ; FCS teams have the same 85-player limit as FBS teams , but are only allowed to give aid equivalent to 63 full scholarships . FCS teams are allowed to award partial scholarships , a practice technically allowed but essentially never used at the FBS level . FBS teams also have to meet minimum attendance requirements ( average 15,000 people in actual or paid attendance per home game ) , while FCS teams do not need to meet minimum attendance requirements .   Another difference is post season play . Since 1978 , FCS teams have played in a college football playoff system to determine a NCAA-sanctioned national champion ; the FBS teams play in bowl games where various polls rank the number one team after the conclusion of the bowl games . Starting with the 2014 postseason , a four-team playoff called the College Football Playoff , replaced the previous one game championship format . Even so , Division I FBS football is still the only NCAA sport in which a yearly champion is not determined by an NCAA-sanctioned championship event .   For the 2014-15 school year , Division I contained 345 of the NCAA 's 1,066 member institutions , with 125 in FBS , 125 in FCS , and 95 non-football schools with six additional schools in transition from Division II to Division I . There was a moratorium on any additional movement up to D-I until 2012 , after which any school that wants to move to D-I must be accepted for membership by a conference and show the NCAA it has the financial ability to support a D-I program .   All D-I schools must field teams in at least seven sports for men and seven for women or six for men and eight for women , with at least two team sports for each gender . Division I schools must meet minimum financial aid awards for their athletics program , and there are maximum financial aid awards for each sport that a Division I school can not exceed . Several other NCAA sanctioned minimums and differences that distinguish Division I from Divisions II and III . Each playing season has to be represented by each gender as well . There are contest and participant minimums for each sport , as well as scheduling criteria . For sports other than football and basketball , Division I schools must play 100 percent of the minimum number of contests against Division I opponents -- anything over the minimum number of games has to be 50 percent Division I. Men 's and women 's basketball teams have to play all but two games against Division I teams ; for men , they must play one-third of all their contests in the home arena .   In addition to the schools that compete fully as D-I institutions , the NCAA allows D-II and D-III schools to classify one men 's and one women 's sport ( other than football or basketball ) as a D-I sport , as long as they sponsored those sports before the latest rules change in 2011 . Also , Division II schools are eligible to compete for Division I national championships in sports that do not have a Division II national championship , and in those sports may also operate under D-I rules and scholarship limits .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

The offense , the team with control of the oval-shaped football , attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball , while the team without control of the ball , the defense , aims to stop their advance and take control of the ball for themselves . The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs , or plays , or else they turn over the football to the opposing team ; if they succeed , they are given a new set of four downs . Points are primarily scored by advancing the ball into the opposing team 's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent 's goalposts for a field goal . The team with the most points at the end of a game wins .   American football evolved in the United States , originating from the sports of association football and rugby football . The first game of American football was played on November 6 , 1869 , between two college teams , Rutgers and Princeton , under rules based on the association football rules of the time . During the latter half of the 1870s , colleges playing association football switched to the Rugby Union code , which allowed carrying the ball . A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp , the `` Father of American Football '' , established the snap , eleven-player teams , and the concept of downs ; later rule changes legalized the forward pass , created the neutral zone , and specified the size and shape of the football .   American football as a whole is the most popular sport in the United States . Professional football and college football are the most popular forms of the game , with the other major levels being high school and youth football . , nearly 1.1 million high school athletes and 70,000 college athletes play the sport in the United States annually , almost all of them men , with a few exceptions . The National Football League , the most popular American football league , has the highest average attendance of any professional sports league in the world ; its championship game , the Super Bowl , ranks among the most-watched club sporting events in the world , and the league has an annual revenue of around US$ 10 billion .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

She was the sovereign of Austria , Hungary , Croatia , Bohemia , Transylvania , Mantua , Milan , Lodomeria and Galicia , the Austrian Netherlands and Parma . By marriage , she was Duchess of Lorraine , Grand Duchess of Tuscany and Holy Roman Empress .   She started her 40-year reign when her father , Emperor Charles VI , died in October 1740 . Charles VI paved the way for her accession with the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 and spent his entire reign securing it . Upon the death of her father , Saxony , Prussia , Bavaria , and France all repudiated the sanction they had recognised during his lifetime . Frederick II of Prussia ( who became Maria Theresa 's greatest enemy for most of her reign ) promptly invaded and took the affluent Habsburg province of Silesia in the nine-year conflict known as the War of the Austrian Succession . Over the course of the war , despite the loss of Silesia and a few minor territories in Italy , Maria Theresa successfully defended her rule over most of the Habsburg empire . Maria Theresa later unsuccessfully tried to reconquer Silesia during the Seven Years ' War .   Maria Theresa and her husband , Francis I , Holy Roman Emperor , had eleven daughters , including the Queen of France and Navarre , the Queen of Naples and Sicily , the Duchess of Parma , and five sons , including two Holy Roman Emperors , Joseph II and Leopold II . Of the sixteen children ten survived to adulthood . Though she was expected to cede power to Francis and Joseph , both of whom were officially her co-rulers in Austria and Bohemia , Maria Theresa was the absolute sovereign who ruled with the counsel of her advisers . She criticised and disapproved of many of Joseph 's actions . Maria Theresa understood the importance of her public persona and was able to simultaneously evoke both esteem and affection from her subjects .   Maria Theresa promulgated financial and educational reforms , with the assistance of Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Haugwitz and Gerard van Swieten , promoted commerce and the development of agriculture , and reorganised Austria 's ramshackle military , all of which strengthened Austria 's international standing . However , she refused to allow religious pluralism and advocated for the state church and contemporary adversary travelers criticized her regime as bigoted and superstitious . As a young monarch who fought two dynastic wars , she believed that her cause should be the cause of her subjects , but in her later years she would believe that their cause must be hers .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

142735,Elizabeth I was the daughter of a salesman.,Elizabeth_I_of_England,"Elizabeth I ( 7 September 1533 -- 24 March 1603 ) was Queen of England and Ireland from 17 November 1558 until her death . Sometimes called The Virgin Queen , Gloriana or Good Queen Bess , the childless Elizabeth was the last monarch of the Tudor dynasty .   Elizabeth was the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn , his second wife , who was executed two-and-a-half years after Elizabeth 's birth . Anne 's marriage to Henry VIII was annulled , and Elizabeth was declared illegitimate . Her half-brother , Edward VI , ruled until his death in 1553 , bequeathing the crown to Lady Jane Grey and ignoring the claims of his two half-sisters , Elizabeth and the Roman Catholic Mary , in spite of statute law to the contrary . Edward 's will was set aside and Mary became queen , deposing Lady Jane Grey . During Mary 's reign , Elizabeth was imprisoned for nearly a year on suspicion of supporting Protestant rebels .   In 1558 , Elizabeth succeeded her half-sister to the throne and set out to rule by good counsel . She depended heavily on a group of trusted advisers , led by William Cecil , 1st Baron Burghley . One of her first actions as queen was the establishment of an English Protestant church , of which she became the Supreme Governor . This Elizabethan Religious Settlement was to evolve into the Church of England . It was expected that Elizabeth would marry and produce an heir to continue the Tudor line . She never did , despite numerous courtships . As she grew older , Elizabeth became famous for her virginity . A cult grew around her which was celebrated in the portraits , pageants , and literature of the day .   In government , Elizabeth was more moderate than her father and half-siblings had been . One of her mottoes was `` video et taceo '' ( `` I see but say nothing '' ) . In religion , she was relatively tolerant and avoided systematic persecution . After the pope declared her illegitimate in 1570 and released her subjects from obedience to her , several conspiracies threatened her life , all of which were defeated with the help of her ministers ' secret service . Elizabeth was cautious in foreign affairs , manoeuvring between the major powers of France and Spain . She only half-heartedly supported a number of ineffective , poorly resourced military campaigns in the Netherlands , France , and Ireland . By the mid-1580s , England could no longer avoid war with Spain . England 's defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 associated Elizabeth with one of the greatest military victories in English history .   Elizabeth 's reign is known as the Elizabethan era . The period is famous for the flourishing of English drama , led by playwrights such as William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe , and for the seafaring prowess of English adventurers such as Francis Drake . Some historians depict Elizabeth as a short-tempered , sometimes indecisive ruler , who enjoyed more than her share of luck . Towards the end of her reign , a series of economic and military problems weakened her popularity . Elizabeth is acknowledged as a charismatic performer and a dogged survivor in an era when government was ramshackle and limited , and when monarchs in neighbouring countries faced internal problems that jeopardised their thrones . Such was the case with Elizabeth 's rival , Mary , Queen of Scots , whom she imprisoned in 1568 and had executed in 1587 . After the short reigns of Elizabeth 's half-siblings , her 44 years on the throne provided welcome stability for the kingdom and helped forge a sense of national identity .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

The film was heavily panned , and was considered a box office bomb , having lost over $ 6 million .   A replica of the Bounty was constructed for the film .

Bastia , the prefecture city of Haute-Corse , is the second-largest settlement in Corsica .   After being ruled by the Republic of Genoa since 1284 , Corsica was briefly an independent Corsican Republic from 1755 until it was conquered by France in 1769 . Due to Corsica 's historical ties with the Italian peninsula , the island retains to this day many elements of the culture of Italy . The native Corsican language , whose northern variant is closely related to the Italian language , is recognised as a regional language by the French government . This Mediterranean island was ruled by various nations over the course of history but had several brief periods of independence .   Napoleon was born in 1769 in the Corsican capital of Ajaccio .

Hezbollah 's paramilitary wing is the Jihad Council , and its political wing is Loyalty to the Resistance Bloc party in the Lebanese parliament . After the death of Abbas al-Musawi in 1992 , the group has been headed by Hassan Nasrallah , its Secretary-General .   After the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 in support of the Free Lebanon State , Israel occupied a strip of south Lebanon , which was controlled by the South Lebanon Army ( SLA ) , a Lebanese Christian militia supported by Israel . Hezbollah was conceived by Muslim clerics and funded by Iran primarily to harass the Israeli occupation . Its leaders were followers of Ayatollah Khomeini , and its forces were trained and organized by a contingent of 1,500 Revolutionary Guards that arrived from Iran with permission from the Syrian government , which was in occupation of Lebanon at the time . Hezbollah 's 1985 manifesto listed its objectives as the expulsion of `` the Americans , the French and their allies definitely from Lebanon , putting an end to any colonialist entity on our land '' , submission of the Phalangists to `` just power '' and bringing them to justice `` for the crimes they have perpetrated against Muslims and Christians '' , and permitting `` all the sons of our people '' to choose the form of government they want , while calling on them to `` pick the option of Islamic government '' .   Hezbollah waged a guerilla campaign in South Lebanon and as a result , Israel withdrew from Lebanon on May 24 , 2000 , and SLA collapsed and surrendered . Backed by Iran , Hezbollah fighters fought against Serbian forces during the Bosnian War . Hezbollah 's military strength has grown so significantly that its paramilitary wing is considered more powerful than the Lebanese Army . Hezbollah has been described as a `` state within a state '' , and has grown into an organization with seats in the Lebanese government , a radio and a satellite TV station , social services and large-scale military deployment of fighters beyond Lebanon 's borders . Hezbollah is part of the March 8 Alliance within Lebanon , in opposition to the March 14 Alliance . Hezbollah maintains strong support among Lebanon 's Shi'a population , while Sunnis have disagreed with the group 's agenda . Hezbollah receives military training , weapons , and financial support from Iran , and political support from Syria . Hezbollah and Israel fought each other in the 2006 Lebanon War .   After the 2006 -- 08 Lebanese protests and clashes , a national unity government was formed in 2008 , with Hezbollah and its opposition allies obtaining eleven of thirty cabinets seats , which gives them veto power . In August 2008 , Lebanon 's new Cabinet unanimously approved a draft policy statement which recognized Hezbollah 's existence as an armed organization and guarantees its right to `` liberate or recover occupied lands '' ( such as the Shebaa Farms ) . Since 2012 , Hezbollah has helped the Syrian government during the Syrian civil war in its fight against the Syrian opposition , which Hezbollah has described as a Zionist plot and a `` Wahhabi-Zionist conspiracy '' to destroy its alliance with Assad against Israel . It has deployed its militia in both Syria and Iraq to fight or train local forces to fight against ISIS . Once seen as a resistance movement throughout much of the Arab world , this image upon which the group 's legitimacy rested has been severely damaged due to the sectarian nature of the Syrian Civil War in which it has become embroiled .   Hezbollah 's status as a legitimate political party , a terrorist group , a resistance movement , or some combination thereof is a contentious issue . The Arab League , United States , France , the Gulf Cooperation Council , Australia , Canada , the Netherlands , and Israel have classified Hezbollah as a terrorist organization . The European Union , New Zealand and the United Kingdom have proscribed Hezbollah 's military wing as a terrorist organization , while making a distinction with Hezbollah 's political wing .

He conquered Samarkand two years later , only to lose the city of Fergana soon after . In his attempt to reconquer Fergana , he lost control of Samarkand . In 1501 , his attempt to recapture both cities went in vain as he was defeated by Muhammad Shaybani Khan . In 1504 , he conquered Kabul , which was under the rule of the infant heir of Ulugh Begh . Babur formed a partnership with Safavid ruler Ismail I and reconquered parts of central Asia , including Samarkand , only to again lose it and the other newly conquered lands to the Uzbeks .   After losing Samarkand for the third time , Babur turned his attention to creating his empire in north India . At that time , the Indo-Gangetic Plain of the northern Indian Subcontinent was ruled by Ibrahim Lodi of the Afghan Lodi dynasty , whereas Rajputana was ruled by a Hindu Rajput Confederacy , led by Rana Sanga of Mewar . In 1524 , Daulat Khan Lodi , a rebel of the Lodhi dynasty , invited Babur to overthrow Ibrahim and become ruler . Babur defeated Ibrahim Lodi at the First Battle of Panipat in 1526 and founded the Mughal empire . However , he again faced opposition , this time from Rana Sanga of Mewar who considered Babur a foreigner . The Rana was defeated at the Battle of Khanwa .   Babur married several times . Notable among his sons are Humayun , Kamran Mirza and Hindal Mirza . Babur died in 1530 and was succeeded by Humayun . According to Babur 's wishes , he was buried in Bagh-e-Babur in Kabul , Afghanistan . Being a patrilineal descendant of Timur , Babur considered himself a Timurid and Turk , though Uzbek sources claim him as an ethnic Uzbek . He is considered a national hero in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan . Many of his poems also have become popular folk songs . He wrote his autobiography , Baburnama , in Chaghatai Turkic and this was translated into Persian during Akbar 's reign .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

78914,Delivery of the Gettysburg Address was by an important person that was murdered.,Abraham_Lincoln,"Abraham Lincoln ( -LSB- ˈeɪbrəhæm_ˈlIŋkən -RSB- February 12 , 1809 -- April 15 , 1865 ) was an American politician and lawyer who served as the 16th President of the United States from March 1861 until his assassination in April 1865 . Lincoln led the United States through its Civil War -- its bloodiest war and perhaps its greatest moral , constitutional , and political crisis . In doing so , he preserved the Union , paved the way to the abolition of slavery , strengthened the federal government , and modernized the economy .   Born in Hodgenville , Kentucky , Lincoln grew up on the western frontier in Kentucky and Indiana . Largely self-educated , he became a lawyer in Illinois , a Whig Party leader , and was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives , in which he served for eight years . Elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1846 , Lincoln promoted rapid modernization of the economy through banks , tariffs , and railroads . Because he had originally agreed not to run for a second term in Congress , and because his opposition to the Mexican -- American War was unpopular among Illinois voters , Lincoln returned to Springfield and resumed his successful law practice . Reentering politics in 1854 , he became a leader in building the new Republican Party , which had a statewide majority in Illinois . In 1858 , while taking part in a series of highly publicized debates with his opponent and rival , Democrat Stephen A. Douglas , Lincoln spoke out against the expansion of slavery , but lost the U.S. Senate race to Douglas .   In 1860 , Lincoln secured the Republican Party presidential nomination as a moderate from a swing state . Though he gained very little support in the slaveholding states of the South , he swept the North and was elected president in 1860 . Lincoln 's victory prompted seven southern slave states to form the Confederate States of America before he moved into the White House -- no compromise or reconciliation was found regarding slavery and secession . Subsequently , on April 12 , 1861 , a Confederate attack on Fort Sumter inspired the North to enthusiastically rally behind the Union . As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican Party , Lincoln confronted Radical Republicans , who demanded harsher treatment of the South , War Democrats , who called for more compromise , anti-war Democrats ( called Copperheads ) , who despised him , and irreconcilable secessionists , who plotted his assassination . Politically , Lincoln fought back by pitting his opponents against each other , by carefully planned political patronage , and by appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory . His Gettysburg Address became an iconic endorsement of the principles of nationalism , republicanism , equal rights , liberty , and democracy .   Lincoln initially concentrated on the military and political dimensions of the war . His primary goal was to reunite the nation . He suspended habeas corpus , leading to the controversial ex parte Merryman decision , and he averted potential British intervention in the war by defusing the Trent Affair in late 1861 . Lincoln closely supervised the war effort , especially the selection of top generals , including his most successful general , Ulysses S. Grant . He also made major decisions on Union war strategy , including a naval blockade that shut down the South 's normal trade , moves to take control of Kentucky and Tennessee , and using gunboats to gain control of the southern river system . Lincoln tried repeatedly to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond ; each time a general failed , Lincoln substituted another , until finally Grant succeeded . As the war progressed , his complex moves toward ending slavery included the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 ; Lincoln used the U.S. Army to protect escaped slaves , encouraged the border states to outlaw slavery , and pushed through Congress the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , which permanently outlawed slavery .   An exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state , Lincoln reached out to the War Democrats and managed his own re-election campaign in the 1864 presidential election . Anticipating the war 's conclusion , Lincoln pushed a moderate view of Reconstruction , seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness . On April 14 , 1865 , five days after the surrender of Confederate commanding general Robert E. Lee , Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth , a Confederate sympathizer .   Lincoln has been consistently ranked both by scholars and the public as among the greatest U.S. presidents .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Directed by John Lasseter and co-directed by Lee Unkrich and Ash Brannon , it is the sequel to the 1995 film Toy Story .   In the film , Woody is stolen by a toy collector , prompting Buzz Lightyear and his friends to vow to rescue him , but Woody is then tempted by the idea of immortality in a museum . Many of the original characters and voices from Toy Story return for this sequel , and several new characters -- including Jessie ( voiced by Joan Cusack ) , Barbie ( voiced by Jodi Benson ) , Stinky Pete ( voiced by Kelsey Grammer ) and Mrs. Potato Head ( voiced by Estelle Harris ) -- are introduced . It was the last Toy Story film that starred Jim Varney as Slinky Dog before his death in 2000 .   Disney initially envisioned the film as a direct-to-video sequel . Toy Story 2 began production in a building separated from Pixar , on a small scale , as most of the main Pixar staff were busy working on A Bug 's Life ( 1998 ) . When story reels proved promising , Disney upgraded the film to theatrical release , but Pixar was unhappy with the film 's quality . Lasseter and the story team redeveloped the entire plot in one weekend . Although most Pixar features take years to develop , the established release date could not be moved and the production schedule for Toy Story 2 was compressed into nine months .   Despite production struggles , Toy Story 2 opened in November 1999 to wildly successful box office numbers , eventually grossing over $ 497 million , and received universal acclaim from critics . Toy Story 2 has been considered by critics to be one of few sequel films to outshine the original , and it continues to be featured frequently on lists of the greatest animated films ever made . The film has seen multiple home media releases and a theatrical 3-D re-release in 2009 , 10 years after its initial release .

The conference includes the flagship public university in each of 11 states stretching from New Jersey to Nebraska , as well as two additional public land grant schools and a private university .   The Big Ten Conference was established in 1895 when Purdue University president James H.

Northwestern University , one of just two full members with a total enrollment of fewer than 30,000 students ( the other is the University of Nebraska -- Lincoln ) , is the lone private university among Big Ten membership ( the University of Chicago , a private university , left the conference in 1946 ) . Collectively , Big Ten universities educate more than 520,000 total students and have 5.7 million living alumni . Big Ten universities engage in $ 9.3 billion in funded research each year . Though the Big Ten existed for nearly a century as an assemblage of universities located primarily in the Midwest , the conference 's geographic footprint now spans from the state of Nebraska in the west to the Atlantic Ocean in the east .   Big Ten universities are also members of the Big Ten Academic Alliance , an academic consortium . In 2014 -- 2015 , members generated more than $ 10 billion in research expenditures .

It is the largest and most populous British city outside London , with a population of 1,101,360 in 2014 .   A medium-sized market town in the medieval period , Birmingham grew to international prominence in the 18th century at the heart of the Midlands Enlightenment and subsequent Industrial Revolution , which saw the town at the forefront of worldwide advances in science , technology , and economic development , producing a series of innovations that laid many of the foundations of modern industrial society . By 1791 it was being hailed as `` the first manufacturing town in the world '' . Birmingham 's distinctive economic profile , with thousands of small workshops practising a wide variety of specialised and highly skilled trades , encouraged exceptional levels of creativity and innovation and provided a diverse and resilient economic base for industrial prosperity that was to last into the final quarter of the 20th century . Perhaps the most important invention in British history , the industrial steam engine , was invented in Birmingham . Its resulting high level of social mobility also fostered a culture of broad-based political radicalism , that under leaders from Thomas Attwood to Joseph Chamberlain was to give it a political influence unparalleled in Britain outside London , and a pivotal role in the development of British democracy . From the summer of 1940 to the spring of 1943 , Birmingham was bombed heavily by the German Luftwaffe in what is known as the Birmingham Blitz . The damage done to the city 's infrastructure , in addition to a deliberate policy of demolition and new building by planners , led to extensive demolition and redevelopment in subsequent decades .   Today Birmingham 's economy is dominated by the service sector . The city is a major international commercial centre , ranked as a gamma + world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ; and an important transport , retail , events and conference hub . Its metropolitan economy is the second largest in the United Kingdom with a GDP of $ 121.1 bn ( 2014 ) , and its six universities make it the largest centre of higher education in the country outside London . Birmingham 's major cultural institutions -- including the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra , the Birmingham Royal Ballet , the Birmingham Repertory Theatre , the Library of Birmingham and the Barber Institute of Fine Arts -- enjoy international reputations , and the city has vibrant and influential grassroots art , music , literary and culinary scenes . Birmingham is the fourth-most visited city in the UK by foreign visitors .   Birmingham 's sporting heritage can be felt worldwide , with the concept of the Football League and lawn tennis both originating from the city . Its most successful football club Aston Villa has won seven league titles and one European Cup with the other professional club being Birmingham City .   People from Birmingham are called Brummies , a term derived from the city 's nickname of Brum . This originates from the city 's dialect name , Brummagem , which may in turn have been derived from one of the city 's earlier names , Bromwicham .

It is separated from Tajikistan by Afghanistan 's narrow Wakhan Corridor in the north , and also shares a maritime border with Oman .   The territory that now constitutes Pakistan is considered a cradle of civilisation that was previously home to several ancient cultures , including the Mehrgarh of the Neolithic and the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilisation , and later home to kingdoms ruled by people of different faiths and cultures , including Hindus , Indo-Greeks , Muslims , Turco-Mongols , Afghans , and Sikhs . The area has been ruled by numerous empires and dynasties , including the Persian Achaemenid Empire , Alexander of Macedonia , the Indian Mauryan Empire , the Arab Umayyad Caliphate , the Delhi Sultanate , the Mongol Empire , the Mughal Empire , the Durrani Empire , the Sikh Empire , and most recently , the British Empire .   Pakistan is unique among Muslim countries in that it is the only country to have been created in the name of Islam . As a result of the Pakistan Movement led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah and the subcontinent 's struggle for independence , Pakistan was created in 1947 as an independent homeland for South Asian Muslims . It is an ethnically and linguistically diverse country , with a similarly diverse geography and wildlife . Initially a dominion , Pakistan adopted a constitution in 1956 , becoming an Islamic republic . An ethnic civil war in 1971 resulted in the secession of East Pakistan as the new country of Bangladesh . In 1973 Pakistan adopted a new constitution establishing , alongside its pre-existing parliamentary republic status , a federal government based in Islamabad consisting of four provinces and four federal territories . The new constitution also stipulated that all laws were to conform to the injunctions of Islam as laid down in the Quran and Sunnah .   A regional and middle power , Pakistan has the sixth-largest standing armed forces in the world and is also a nuclear power as well as a declared nuclear-weapons state , being the second in South Asia and the only nation in the Muslim world to have that status . Pakistan has a semi-industrialised economy with a well-integrated agriculture sector , and a growing services sector . The Pakistani economy is the 24th-largest in the world in terms of purchasing power and the 41st-largest in terms of nominal GDP ( World Bank ) . It is ranked among the emerging and growth-leading economies of the world , and is backed by one of the world 's largest and fastest-growing middle classes .   The post-independence history of Pakistan has been characterised by periods of military rule , and since 2008 a transition to democracy , amid conflicts with neighbouring India . The country continues to face challenging problems such as illiteracy , healthcare , and corruption , but has substantially reduced poverty and terrorism and expanded per capita income . Pakistan is a member of the United Nations , the Non-Aligned Movement , the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation , the Commonwealth of Nations , the ECO , the SAARC , the Developing Eight , and the G20 developing nations , Group of 24 , Group of 77 , and ECOSOC . It is also an associate member of CERN . Pakistan is a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol , the Paris Agreement , and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

194748,L. Ron Hubbard spent the remaining years of his life solely in Germany.,L._Ron_Hubbard,"Lafayette Ronald Hubbard ( March 13 , 1911 -- January 24 , 1986 ) , better known as L. Ron Hubbard ( -LSB- ɛl_rɒn_ˈhʌˌbərd -RSB- ) and often referred to by his initials , LRH , was an American author and the founder of the Church of Scientology . In 2014 , Hubbard was cited by the Smithsonian magazine as one of the 100 most significant Americans of all time , as one of the eleven religious figures on that list . After establishing a career as a writer , becoming best known for his science fiction and fantasy stories , he developed a system called Dianetics which was first expounded in book form in May 1950 . He subsequently developed his ideas into a wide-ranging set of doctrines and practices as part of a new religious movement that he called Scientology . His writings became the guiding texts for the Church of Scientology and a number of affiliated organizations that address such diverse topics as business administration , literacy and drug rehabilitation . The Church 's dissemination of these materials led to Hubbard being listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the most translated and published author in the world . The Guinness World Record for the most audio books published for one author is also held by Hubbard .   Although many aspects of Hubbard 's life story are disputed , there is general agreement about its basic outline . Born in Tilden , Nebraska , he spent much of his childhood in Helena , Montana . He traveled in Asia and the South Pacific in the late 1920s after his father , an officer in the United States Navy , was posted to the U.S. naval base on Guam . He attended George Washington University in Washington , D.C. at the start of the 1930s , before dropping out and beginning his career as a prolific writer of pulp fiction stories . He served briefly in the United States Marine Corps Reserve and was an officer in the United States Navy during World War II , briefly commanding two ships , the USS YP-422 and USS PC-815 . He was removed both times when his superiors found him incapable of command . The last few months of his active service were spent in a hospital , being treated for a duodenal ulcer .   After the war , Hubbard developed a philosophy he called Dianetics , which he called `` the modern science of mental health '' . He founded Scientology in 1952 and oversaw the growth of the Church of Scientology into a worldwide organization . During the late 1960s and early 1970s , he spent much of his time at sea on his personal fleet of ships as `` Commodore '' of the Sea Organization , an elite inner group of Scientologists . His expedition came to an end when Britain , Greece , Spain , Portugal , and Venezuela all closed their ports to his fleet . At one point , a court in Australia revoked the Church 's status as a religion , though it was later reinstated . Hubbard returned to the United States in 1975 and went into seclusion in the California desert . In 1978 , a trial court in France convicted Hubbard of fraud in absentia . Others convictions from the same trial were reversed on appeal , but Hubbard died before the court considered his case .   In 1983 L. Ron Hubbard was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in an international information infiltration and theft project called `` Operation Snow White '' . He spent the remaining years of his life on his ranch , the `` Whispering Wind , '' near Creston , California , where he died in 1986 . A small group of Scientology officials and physician Dr. Eugene Denk attended to him before his death , for a number of ailments including chronic pancreatitis . In 1986 , he died at age 74 in a 1982 Blue Bird motor home , which was situated on his property .   The Church of Scientology describes Hubbard in hagiographic terms , and he portrayed himself as a pioneering explorer , world traveler , and nuclear physicist with expertise in a wide range of disciplines , including photography , art , poetry , and philosophy . In Scientology publications , he is referred to as `` Founder '' and `` Source '' of Scientology and Dianetics . His critics , including his own son Ronald DeWolf , have characterized him as a liar , a charlatan , and mentally unstable , though DeWolf later repudiated those statements . Though many of Hubbard 's autobiographical statements have been found to be fictitious , the Church rejects any suggestion that its account of Hubbard 's life is not historical fact .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

15980,Parkinson's disease causes symptoms.,Parkinson's_disease,"Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) is a long-term degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that mainly affects the motor system . The symptoms generally come on slowly over time . Early in the disease , the most obvious are shaking , rigidity , slowness of movement , and difficulty with walking . Thinking and behavioral problems may also occur . Dementia becomes common in the advanced stages of the disease . Depression and anxiety are also common occurring in more than a third of people with PD . Other symptoms include sensory , sleep , and emotional problems . The main motor symptoms are collectively called `` parkinsonism '' , or a `` parkinsonian syndrome '' .   The cause of Parkinson 's disease is generally unknown , but believed to involve both genetic and environmental factors . Those with a family member affected are more likely to get the disease themselves . There is also an increased risk in people exposed to certain pesticides and among those who have had prior head injuries while there is a reduced risk in tobacco smokers and those who drink coffee or tea . The motor symptoms of the disease result from the death of cells in the substantia nigra , a region of the midbrain . This results in not enough dopamine in these areas . The reason for this cell death is poorly understood , but involves the build-up of proteins into Lewy bodies in the neurons . Diagnosis of typical cases is mainly based on symptoms , with tests such as neuroimaging being used to rule out other diseases .   There is no cure for Parkinson 's disease . Initial treatment is typically with the antiparkinson medication L-DOPA ( levodopa ) , with dopamine agonists being used once levodopa becomes less effective . As the disease progresses and neurons continue to be lost , these medications become less effective while at the same time they produce a complication marked by involuntary writhing movements . Diet and some forms of rehabilitation have shown some effectiveness at improving symptoms . Surgery to place microelectrodes for deep brain stimulation has been used to reduce motor symptoms in severe cases where drugs are ineffective . Evidence for treatments for the non-movement-related symptoms of PD , such as sleep disturbances and emotional problems , is less strong .   In 2015 , PD affected 6.2 million people and resulted in about 117,400 deaths globally . Parkinson 's disease typically occurs in people over the age of 60 , of which about one percent are affected . Males are more often affected than females . When it is seen in people before the age of 50 , it is called young-onset PD . The average life expectancy following diagnosis is between 7 and 14 years . The disease is named after the English doctor James Parkinson , who published the first detailed description in An Essay on the Shaking Palsy , in 1817 . Public awareness campaigns include World Parkinson 's Day ( on the birthday of James Parkinson , 11 April ) and the use of a red tulip as the symbol of the disease . People with parkinsonism who have increased the public 's awareness of the condition include actor Michael J. Fox , Olympic cyclist Davis Phinney , and late professional boxer Muhammad Ali .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

As the founder of the Timurid Empire in Persia and Central Asia he became the first ruler in the Timurid dynasty .   Born into the Barlas confederation in Transoxiana on 9 April 1336 , Timur gained control of the western Chagatai Khanate by 1370 . From that base he led military campaigns across Western , South and Central Asia , the Caucasus and southern Russia , and emerged as the most powerful ruler in the Muslim world after defeating the Mamluks of Egypt and Syria , the emerging Ottoman Empire , and the declining Delhi Sultanate . From these conquests he founded the Timurid Empire , but this empire fragmented shortly after his death .   Timur is considered the last of the great nomadic conquerors of the Eurasian Steppe , and his empire set the stage for the rise of the more structured and lasting Gunpowder Empires in the 1500s and 1600s . According to John Joseph Saunders , Timur 's background was Iranized and not steppe nomad .   Timur envisioned the restoration of the Mongol Empire of Genghis Khan ( died 1227 ) . `` In his formal correspondence Temur continued throughout his life to portray himself as the restorer of Chinggisid rights . He justified his Iranian , Mamluk , and Ottoman campaigns as a re-imposition of legitimate Mongol control over lands taken by usurpers . To legitimize his conquests , Timur relied on Islamic symbols and language , referred to himself as the `` Sword of Islam '' , and patronized educational and religious institutions . He converted nearly all the Borjigin leaders to Islam during his lifetime .  `` Temur , a non-Chinggisid , tried to build a double legitimacy based on his role as both guardian and restorer of the Mongol Empire . ''  Timur also decisively defeated the Christian Knights Hospitaller at the Siege of Smyrna , styling himself a ghazi . By the end of his reign , Timur had gained complete control over all the remnants of the Chagatai Khanate , the Ilkhanate , and the Golden Horde , and even attempted to restore the Yuan dynasty in China .   Timur 's armies were inclusively multi-ethnic and were feared throughout Asia , Africa , and Europe , sizable parts of which his campaigns laid to waste . Scholars estimate that his military campaigns caused the deaths of 17 million people , amounting to about 5 % of the world population at the time .   He was the grandfather of the renowned Timurid sultan , astronomer and mathematician Ulugh Beg , who ruled Central Asia from 1411 to 1449 , and the great-great-great-grandfather of Babur ( 1483-1530 ) , founder of the Mughal Empire , which ruled parts of South Asia for over three centuries , from 1526 until 1857 .  Timur is also recognized as a great patron of art and architecture , as he interacted with Muslim intellectuals such as Ibn Khaldun and Hafiz-i Abru .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with its neighbor Chile to the west , the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north , Brazil to the northeast , Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east , and the Drake Passage to the south . With a mainland area of 2780400 km2 , Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world , the second largest in Latin America , and the largest Spanish-speaking one . The country is subdivided into twenty-three provinces ( provincias , singular provincia ) and one autonomous city ( ciudad autónoma ) , Buenos Aires , which is the federal capital of the nation ( -LSB- Capital Federal , links = no -RSB- ) as decided by Congress .  The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions , but exist under a federal system .   Argentina claims sovereignty over part of Antarctica , the Falkland Islands ( -LSB- Islas Malvinas , links = no -RSB- ) , and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands . The earliest recorded human presence in the area of modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period . The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century . Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata , a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776 . The declaration and fight for independence ( 1810 -- 1818 ) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861 , culminating in the country 's reorganization as a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city . The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability , with massive waves of European immigration radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook . The almost-unparalleled increase in prosperity led to Argentina becoming the seventh wealthiest developed nation in the world by the early 20th century .   After 1930 , Argentina descended into political instability and periodic economic crises that pushed it back into underdevelopment , though it nevertheless remained among the fifteen richest countries until the mid-20th century . Argentina retains its historic status as a middle power in international affairs , and is a prominent regional power in the Southern Cone and Latin America . Argentina has the second largest economy in South America , the third-largest in Latin America and is a member of the G-15 and G-20 major economies . It is also a founding member of the United Nations , World Bank , World Trade Organization , Mercosur , Union of South American Nations , Community of Latin American and Caribbean States and the Organization of Ibero-American States . It is the country with the second highest Human Development Index in Latin America with a rating of `` very high '' .

It is the largest and most populous British city outside London , with a population of 1,101,360 in 2014 .   A medium-sized market town in the medieval period , Birmingham grew to international prominence in the 18th century at the heart of the Midlands Enlightenment and subsequent Industrial Revolution , which saw the town at the forefront of worldwide advances in science , technology , and economic development , producing a series of innovations that laid many of the foundations of modern industrial society . By 1791 it was being hailed as `` the first manufacturing town in the world '' . Birmingham 's distinctive economic profile , with thousands of small workshops practising a wide variety of specialised and highly skilled trades , encouraged exceptional levels of creativity and innovation and provided a diverse and resilient economic base for industrial prosperity that was to last into the final quarter of the 20th century . Perhaps the most important invention in British history , the industrial steam engine , was invented in Birmingham . Its resulting high level of social mobility also fostered a culture of broad-based political radicalism , that under leaders from Thomas Attwood to Joseph Chamberlain was to give it a political influence unparalleled in Britain outside London , and a pivotal role in the development of British democracy . From the summer of 1940 to the spring of 1943 , Birmingham was bombed heavily by the German Luftwaffe in what is known as the Birmingham Blitz . The damage done to the city 's infrastructure , in addition to a deliberate policy of demolition and new building by planners , led to extensive demolition and redevelopment in subsequent decades .   Today Birmingham 's economy is dominated by the service sector . The city is a major international commercial centre , ranked as a gamma + world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ; and an important transport , retail , events and conference hub . Its metropolitan economy is the second largest in the United Kingdom with a GDP of $ 121.1 bn ( 2014 ) , and its six universities make it the largest centre of higher education in the country outside London . Birmingham 's major cultural institutions -- including the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra , the Birmingham Royal Ballet , the Birmingham Repertory Theatre , the Library of Birmingham and the Barber Institute of Fine Arts -- enjoy international reputations , and the city has vibrant and influential grassroots art , music , literary and culinary scenes . Birmingham is the fourth-most visited city in the UK by foreign visitors .   Birmingham 's sporting heritage can be felt worldwide , with the concept of the Football League and lawn tennis both originating from the city . Its most successful football club Aston Villa has won seven league titles and one European Cup with the other professional club being Birmingham City .   People from Birmingham are called Brummies , a term derived from the city 's nickname of Brum . This originates from the city 's dialect name , Brummagem , which may in turn have been derived from one of the city 's earlier names , Bromwicham .

The leadership consists of Greg Maffei ( chief executive officer of Liberty Media ) as chairman and Canadian Michael Rapino ( previously chief executive officer of Live Nation ) as president and CEO of the company .   The merger that formed the company was opposed by members of the United States Congress , business rivals , and the Computer & Communications Industry Association ( CCIA ) , whose members include Google , Oracle , Microsoft , Yahoo , Intuit , and eBay .   The merger initially received regulatory approval in Norway and Turkey in 2009 . In October 2009 , the United Kingdom 's Competition Commission provisionally ruled against the merger . On December 22 , 2009 , the Competition Commission reversed its decision and cleared the proposed merger . The United States Justice Department approved the merger on January 25 , 2010 , with some conditions to which both parties agreed .   As part of the agreement with governments to merge , Ticketmaster had to sell its ownership in its self-ticketing company , Paciolan and Live Nation Entertainment was placed under a 10-year court order prohibiting it from retaliating against venues that choose to accept competitors ' ticket-selling contracts , and it `` must allow venues that sign deals elsewhere to take consumer ticketing data with them '' .   In addition , the new company had to license a copy of its ticketing software to two companies -- Anschutz Entertainment Group ( AEG ) and either Comcast Spectacor or another `` suitable '' company -- so that both companies could compete `` head-to-head '' with Ticketmaster for venues ' business . AEG was given the option after five years to buy the software , replacing it with something else , or partnering with another ticketing company .

It was the flagship product of the Netscape Communications Corp and was the dominant web browser in terms of usage share in the 1990s , but by 2002 its usage had almost disappeared . This was primarily due to the increased usage of Microsoft 's Internet Explorer web browser software , and partly because the Netscape Corporation ( later purchased by AOL ) did not sustain Netscape Navigator 's technical innovation after the late 1990s .   The business demise of Netscape was a central premise of Microsoft 's antitrust trial , wherein the Court ruled that Microsoft Corporation 's bundling of Internet Explorer with the Windows operating system was a monopolistic and illegal business practice . The decision came too late for Netscape , however , as Internet Explorer had by then become the dominant web browser in Windows .   The Netscape Navigator web browser was succeeded by the Netscape Communicator suite in 1997 . Netscape Communicator 's 4.x source code was the base for the Netscape-developed Mozilla Application Suite , which was later renamed SeaMonkey .

When story reels proved promising , Disney upgraded the film to theatrical release , but Pixar was unhappy with the film 's quality . Lasseter and the story team redeveloped the entire plot in one weekend .

117948,Dark matter is different from baryonic matter.,Dark_matter,"Dark matter is a hypothetical type of matter distinct from baryonic matter ( ordinary matter such as protons and neutrons ) , neutrinos and dark energy . The existence of dark matter would explain a number of otherwise puzzling astronomical observations . The name refers to the fact that it does not emit or interact with electromagnetic radiation , such as light , and is thus invisible to the entire electromagnetic spectrum . Although dark matter has not been directly observed , its existence and properties are inferred from its gravitational effects such as the motions of visible matter , gravitational lensing , its influence on the universe 's large-scale structure , on galaxies , and its effects in the cosmic microwave background .   The standard model of cosmology indicates that the total mass -- energy of the universe contains 4.9 % ordinary matter , 26.8 % dark matter and 68.3 % dark energy . Thus , dark matter constitutes 84.5 % Since dark energy , by convention , does not count as `` matter '' , this is 26.8 / ( 4.9 + 26.8 ) = 0.845 of total mass , while dark energy plus dark matter constitute 95.1 % of total mass -- energy content . The great majority of ordinary matter in the universe is also unseen , since visible stars and gas inside galaxies and clusters account for less than 10 % of the ordinary matter contribution to the mass-energy density of the universe . The most widely accepted hypothesis on the form for dark matter is that it is composed of weakly interacting massive particles ( WIMPs ) that interact only through gravity and the weak force .  The dark matter hypothesis plays a central role in current modeling of cosmic structure formation and galaxy formation and evolution and on explanations of the anisotropies observed in the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) . All these lines of evidence suggest that galaxies , galaxy clusters , and the universe as a whole contain far more matter than that which is observable via electromagnetic signals . Many experiments to detect proposed dark matter particles through non-gravitational means are under way ; however , no dark matter particle has been conclusively identified .   Although the existence of dark matter is generally accepted by most of the astronomical community , a minority of astronomers , motivated by the lack of conclusive identification of dark matter , argue for various modifications of the standard laws of general relativity , such as  MOND , TeVeS , and conformal gravity that attempt to account for the observations without invoking additional matter .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

140750,"In Kentucky, the electric chair has been retired except for those whose capital crimes were committed prior to March 31, 1998, and who choose electrocution as their preferred mode of death.",Electric_chair,"Execution by electrocution , performed using an electric chair , is a method of execution originating in the United States in which the condemned person is strapped to a specially built wooden chair and electrocuted through electrodes fastened on the head and leg . This execution method , conceived in 1881 by a Buffalo , New York , dentist named Alfred P. Southwick , was developed throughout the 1880s as a humane alternative to hanging and first used in 1890 . This execution method has been used in the United States and , for a period of several decades , in the Philippines ( its first use there in 1924 , last in 1976 ) .   Historically , once the condemned person was attached to the chair , various cycles ( differing in voltage and duration ) of alternating current would be passed through the individual 's body , in order to cause fatal damage to the internal organs ( including the brain ) . The first more powerful jolt of electric current was designed to pass through the head and cause immediate unconsciousness and brain death . The second less powerful jolt was designed to cause fatal damage to the vital organs . Death may also be caused by electrical overstimulation of the heart .   Although the electric chair has long been a symbol of the death penalty in the United States , its use is in decline due to the rise of lethal injection , which is widely believed to be a more humane method of execution . Although some states still maintain electrocution as a method of execution , today it is only maintained as a secondary method that may be chosen over lethal injection at the request of the prisoner , except in Tennessee where it may be used if the drugs for lethal injection are not available , without input from the prisoner . As of 2014 , electrocution is an optional form of execution in Alabama , Florida , South Carolina and Virginia . They allow the prisoner to choose lethal injection as an alternative method . In the state of Kentucky the electric chair has been retired except for those whose capital crimes were committed prior to March 31 , 1998 , and who choose electrocution ; inmates who do not choose electrocution and inmates who committed their crimes after the designated date are executed by lethal injection . In the state of Tennessee the electric chair is available for use if lethal injection drugs are unavailable , or otherwise if the inmate so chooses if their capital crime was committed before 1999 . The electric chair is an alternate form of execution approved for potential use in Arkansas and Oklahoma if other forms of execution are found unconstitutional in the state at the time of execution . On February 8 , 2008 , the Nebraska Supreme Court determined that execution by electric chair was a `` cruel and unusual punishment '' under the state 's constitution . This brought executions of this type to an end in Nebraska , the only remaining state to retain electrocution as its sole method of execution .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

As Chancellor of the Exchequer ( 1908 -- 1915 ) , Lloyd George was a key figure in the introduction of many reforms which laid the foundations of the modern welfare state . His most important role came as the highly energetic Prime Minister of the Wartime Coalition Government ( 1916 -- 22 ) , during and immediately after the First World War . He was a major player at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 that reordered Europe after the defeat of the Central Powers .   Historian Martin Pugh in The Oxford Companion to British History argues that :  He made a greater impact on British public life than any other 20th-century leader , thanks to his pre-war introduction of Britain 's social welfare system ( especially medical insurance , unemployment insurance , and old-age pensions , largely paid for by taxes on high incomes and on the land ) . Furthermore , in foreign affairs he played a leading role in winning the First World War , redrawing the map of Europe at the peace conference , and partitioning Ireland .   As Prime Minister , Lloyd George favoured the Conservatives in his coalition in the 1918 elections , leaving the Liberal Party a minority . He became leader of the Liberal Party in the late 1920s , but it grew even smaller and more divided . By the 1930s he was a marginalised and widely mistrusted figure . He gave weak support to the Second World War amidst fears that he was favourable toward Germany .

One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines , the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves .   Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines , perhaps the oldest through its inclusion of astronomy . Over the last two millennia , physics was a part of natural philosophy along with chemistry , biology , and certain branches of mathematics , but during the scientific revolution in the 17th century , the natural sciences emerged as unique research programs in their own right . Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research , such as biophysics and quantum chemistry , and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined . New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms of other sciences while opening new avenues of research in areas such as mathematics and philosophy .   Physics also makes significant contributions through advances in new technologies that arise from theoretical breakthroughs . For example , advances in the understanding of electromagnetism or nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products that have dramatically transformed modern-day society , such as television , computers , domestic appliances , and nuclear weapons ; advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization , and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus .

The first series entry , Scream , was released on December 20 , 1996 and is currently the highest-grossing slasher film in the United States . The second entry Scream 2 was released on December 12 , 1997 followed by a third installment , Scream 3 , released February 4 , 2000 . Eleven years after the previous film , Scream 4 was released on April 15 , 2011 . The films follow Sidney Prescott , and her war against a succession of murderers who adopt the guise of Ghostface to stalk and torment their victims . Sidney receives support in the films from town deputy Dewey Riley , reporter Gale Weathers , and film-geek Randy Meeks . A tv spin off of the series was released by MTV on June 30 , 2015 . The series follows different characters and new storylines , not connected to the film series .   Williamson 's original script was bought by Miramax and developed under the Dimension Films label by Bob and Harvey Weinstein , who recruited Craven to direct , who in turn recruited composer Marco Beltrami to score the film . This team went on to be involved in each film in the series though Williamson was forced to take a smaller role for Scream 3 , writing only a brief plot outline due to his commitments to other projects , with Ehren Kruger replacing him as screenwriter . The series ' violence resulted in conflicts with the Motion Picture Association of America and news media concerning censorship resulting in a reduction of violence and gore in Scream 3 when the Columbine High School massacre brought increased focus on the media 's influence on society . Scream became notable for its use of established and recognizable actors which was uncommon for horror films at the time , yet has since become common in part due to Scream 's success .   The series , particularly the first two films , has received significant critical acclaim . Scream has been credited with revitalizing the horror genre in the late 90s by combining a traditional slasher film with humor , awareness of horror film cliché and a clever plot . Scream was one of the highest-grossing films of 1996 and became , and remains , the highest grossing slasher film in the world . Its success was matched by Scream 2 which not only broke box-office records of the time , but was also argued by some critics to actually be superior to the original . Scream 3 fared worse than its predecessors , both critically and financially , with critics commenting that it had become the type of horror film it originally parodied in Scream . It did , however , receive some positive response , with claims that it was the perfect end to the trilogy . The film series has been the recipient of several awards including a Saturn Award for Best Actress and MTV Movie Award for Best Female Performance for Campbell and Best Horror Film for Scream .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

15899,Georgians arose from a place that was a kingdom in the Caucasus.,Georgians,"The Georgians or Kartvelians ( -LSB- ქართველები , tr -RSB- ) are a nation and ethnic group who constitute a majority of the population in Georgia . Large Georgian communities are also present throughout Russia , Turkey , Greece , Iran , Ukraine , United States , and to a lesser extent throughout the European Union .   Georgians arose from the ancient Colchian and Iberian civilizations . After Christianization of Iberia by Saint Nino they became one of the first who embraced the faith of Jesus in the early 4th century and now the majority of Georgians are Eastern Orthodox Christians and most follow their national autocephalous Georgian Orthodox Church . There are also small Georgian Catholic and Muslim communities in Tbilisi and Adjara , as well as a significant number of irreligious Georgians .   A complex process of nation formation has resulted in a diverse set of geographic subgroups of Georgians , each with its characteristic traditions , manners , dialects and , in the case of Svans and Mingrelians , own regional languages . The Georgian language , with its own unique writing system and extensive written tradition , which goes back to the 5th century , is the official language of Georgia as well as the language of education of all Georgians living in the country .   Located on the crossroads of predominantly Christian Europe and Muslim Western Asia , Georgian people have maintained their Christian identity in the face of great pressure from neighboring Muslim empires . By the early 11th century they formed a unified Kingdom of Georgia and inaugurated the Georgian Golden Age , a height of political and cultural power of the nation . This lasted until being weakened by Mongol invasions , as well as internal divisions following the death of George V the Brilliant , the last of the great kings of Georgia . Thereafter and throughout the early modern period Georgians became politically fractured and fell into decline due to the onslaught of various hostile empires , including the Ottoman Empire and successive dynasties of Persia . To ensure Georgia 's survival , in 1783 Heraclius II of Georgia forged an alliance with the Russian Empire , which Georgians viewed as a replacement for their fallen traditional ally -- Byzantine Empire . The Russo-Georgian alliance , however , backfired as Russia was unwilling to fulfill the terms of the treaty , proceeding to annex the troubled kingdom in 1801 . Georgians briefly reasserted their independence from Russia under the First Georgian Republic from 1918-1921 , and finally , in 1991 from the Soviet Union .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

117278,Woodrow Wilson lived in part of the 20th century and was president from 1913 to 1921.,Woodrow_Wilson,"Thomas Woodrow Wilson ( December 28 , 1856 -- February 3 , 1924 ) was an American politician and academic who served as the 28th President of the United States from 1913 to 1921 . A member of the Democratic Party , Wilson served as the President of Princeton University from 1902 to 1910 and as Governor of New Jersey from 1911 to 1913 . Wilson 's victory in the 1912 presidential election made him the first Southerner elected to the presidency since Zachary Taylor in 1848 , and Wilson became a leading force in the Progressive Movement . He also led the United States during World War I , establishing an activist foreign policy known as `` Wilsonianism . '' He was a major leader at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 , where he championed the proposed League of Nations . However , he was unable to obtain Senate approval for U.S. membership . He suffered debilitating strokes in September 1919 ; after that his wife and staff handled most of his presidential duties .   Born in Staunton , Virginia , he spent his early years in Augusta , Georgia and Columbia , South Carolina . His father was a leading Presbyterian in the Confederacy during the Civil War , and Wilson was always a devout Presbyterian and a proud Southerner . He took a law degree and then one of the first PhDs in political science awarded by Johns Hopkins University . He served as a professor and scholar at various institutions before being selected as President of Princeton University , a position he held from 1902 to 1910 . Wilson became a notable academic , arguing for the superiority of the parliamentary system . He was associated with Grover Cleveland and the conservative Bourbon Democrats until 1910 , when he moved left . With the help of state Democratic bosses , Wilson won the 1910 Democratic nomination for governor of New Jersey , and was elected as a fresh reformer , holding office from 1911 to 1913 . He overthrew the same bosses and gained a national reputation . He won the 1912 Democratic presidential nomination after forty-six rounds of balloting , with support from William Jennings Bryan . Former President Theodore Roosevelt 's third party candidacy split the Republican Party , which re-nominated incumbent President William Howard Taft . Wilson won the 1912 election with a plurality of the popular vote and a large majority in the electoral college .   Leading the Congress that was now in Democratic hands , he oversaw the passage of progressive legislative policies unparalleled until the New Deal in 1933 . The Federal Reserve Act , Federal Trade Commission Act , the Clayton Antitrust Act , and the Federal Farm Loan Act were some of these new policies . Having taken office one month after ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment , Wilson called a special session of Congress , whose work culminated in the Revenue Act of 1913 , introducing an income tax and lowering tariffs . Through passage of the Adamson Act that imposed an 8-hour workday for railroads , he averted a railroad strike and an ensuing economic crisis . Upon the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , Wilson maintained a policy of neutrality , while pursuing a more aggressive policy in dealing with Mexico 's civil war . Wilson staffed his government with Southern Democrats who implemented racial segregation at the Treasury , Navy and other Federal offices . In the presidential election of 1916 , Wilson faced former New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes . By a narrow margin , he became the first Democrat since Andrew Jackson elected to two consecutive terms .   In April 1917 , when Germany had resumed unrestricted submarine warfare and sent the Zimmermann Telegram , Wilson asked Congress to declare war in order to make `` the world safe for democracy . '' The United States conducted military operations alongside the Allies , although without a formal alliance . During the war , Wilson focused on diplomacy and financial considerations , leaving military strategy to the generals , especially General John J. Pershing . Through the Selective Service Act , conscription sent 10,000 freshly trained soldiers to France per day by the summer of 1918 . On the home front , he raised income taxes , borrowing billions of dollars through the public 's purchase of Liberty Bonds . He set up the War Industries Board , promoted labor union cooperation , regulated agriculture and food production through the Lever Act , and took direct control of the nation 's railroad system . Wilson asked Congress for what became the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918 , suppressing anti-draft activists . The crackdown was intensified by his Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer to include expulsion of non-citizen radicals during the First Red Scare of 1919 -- 1920 . Early in 1918 , Wilson issued his principles for an end to the war , the Fourteen Points , and in 1919 , following an armistice , he traveled to Paris , promoting the formation of a League of Nations and concluding the Treaty of Versailles . Following his return from Europe , Wilson embarked on a nationwide tour in 1919 to campaign for the treaty , but suffered a severe stroke . The treaty was met with serious concern by Senate Republicans , and the Senate ultimately rejected the treaty . Due to his stroke , Wilson secluded himself in the White House , disability having diminished his power and influence , and he failed in his bid to win re-nomination at the 1920 Democratic National Convention . Wilson retired at the end of his presidency , and he died in 1924 .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ
92429,Jewish people turn towards Temple Mount during prayer.,Temple_Mount,"The Temple Mount ( הַר הַבַּיִת , Har HaBáyit , `` Mount of the House -LSB- of God , i.e. the Temple -RSB- '' ) , known to Muslims as the Haram esh-Sharif ( الحرم الشريف , al-Ḥaram al-Šarīf , `` the Noble Sanctuary '' , or الحرم القدسي الشريف , al-Ḥaram al-Qudsī al-Šarīf , `` the Noble Sanctuary of Jerusalem '' ) , a hill located in the Old City of Jerusalem , is one of the most important religious sites in the world . It has been venerated as a holy site for thousands of years by Judaism , Christianity , and Islam . The present site is dominated by three monumental structures from the early Umayyad period : the al-Aqsa Mosque , the Dome of the Rock and the Dome of the Chain , as well as four minarets . Herodian walls and gates with additions dating back to the late Byzantine and early Islamic periods cut through the flanks of the Mount . Currently it can be reached through eleven gates , ten reserved for Muslims and one for non-Muslims , with guard posts of Israeli police in the vicinity of each .   The Temple Mount is the holiest site in Judaism , which regards it as the place where God 's divine presence is manifested more than in any other place . According to the rabbinic sages whose debates produced the Talmud , it was from here the world expanded into its present form and where God gathered the dust used to create the first human , Adam .   Since at least the first century CE , the site has been associated in Judaism with Mount Moriah ( הַר הַמוריה , Har HaMōriyā ) ; Mount Moriah is the name given by the Hebrew Bible to the location of Abraham 's binding of Isaac , this identification being perpetuated by Jewish and Christian tradition .   Several passages in the Hebrew Bible indicate that during the time when they were written , the Temple Mount was identified as Mount Zion . The Mount Zion mentioned in the later parts of the Book of Isaiah , in the Book of Psalms , and the First Book of Maccabees ( c. 2nd century BCE ) seems to refer to the top of the hill , generally known as the Temple Mount . According to the Book of Samuel , Mount Zion was the site of the Jebusite fortress called the `` stronghold of Zion '' , but once the First Temple was erected , according to the Bible , at the top of the Eastern Hill ( `` Temple Mount '' ) , the name `` Mount Zion '' migrated there too . The name later migrated for a last time , this time to Jerusalem 's Western Hill .   According to the Bible , both Jewish Temples stood at the Temple Mount , though archaeological evidence only exists for the Second Temple . However , the identification of Solomon 's Temple with the area of the Temple Mount is widespread . According to the Bible the site should function as the center of all national life -- a governmental , judicial and religious center . During the Second Temple period it functioned also as an economic center . According to Jewish tradition and scripture , the First Temple was built by King Solomon the son of King David in 957 BCE and destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BCE . The second was constructed under the auspices of Zerubbabel in 516 BCE and destroyed by the Roman Empire in 70 CE . In the 2nd century , the site was used for a temple to Jupiter Capitolinus . It was redeveloped following the Arab conquest . Jewish tradition maintains it is here a Third and final Temple will also be built . The location is the holiest site in Judaism and is the place Jews turn towards during prayer . Due to its extreme sanctity , many Jews will not walk on the Mount itself , to avoid unintentionally entering the area where the Holy of Holies stood , since according to Rabbinical law , some aspect of the divine presence is still present at the site . It was from the Holy of Holies that the High Priest communicated directly with God .   The Temple was of central importance in Jewish worship , in the Tanakh and the Christian Old Testament . In the New Testament it remains the site of several events in the life of Jesus , and Christian loyalty to it as a focal point remained long after his death . After the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE , which came to be regarded by early Christians , as it was by Josephus and the sages of the Jerusalem Talmud , to be a divine act of punishment for the sins of the Jewish people , the Temple Mount lost its significance for Christian worship with the Christians considering it a fulfillment of Christ 's prophecy at , for example , and . It was to this end , proof of a biblical prophecy fulfilled and of Christianity 's victory over Judaism with the New Covenant , that early Christian pilgrims also visited the site . Byzantine Christians , despite some signs of constructive work on the esplanade , generally neglected the Temple Mount , especially when a Jewish attempt to rebuild the Temple was destroyed by the earthquake in 363 . and it became a desolate local rubbish dump , perhaps outside the city limits , as Christian worship in Jerusalem shifted to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre , and Jerusalem 's centrality was replaced by Rome .   Almost immediately after the Muslim conquest of Jerusalem in 638 CE , Caliph ` Omar ibn al Khatab , disgusted by the filth covering the site , had it thoroughly cleaned , and granted Jews access to the site . Among Sunni Muslims , the Mount is widely considered the third holiest site in Islam . Revered as the Noble Sanctuary , the location of Muhammad 's journey to Jerusalem and ascent to heaven , the site is also associated with Jewish biblical prophets who are also venerated in Islam . Muslims preferred to the esplanade as the heart for the Muslim quarter since it had been abandoned by Christians , to avoid disturbing the Christian quarters of Jerusalem . Umayyad Caliphs commissioned the construction of the al-Aqsa Mosque and Dome of the Rock on the site . The Dome was completed in 692 CE , making it one of the oldest extant Islamic structures in the world . The Al Aqsa Mosque rests on the far southern side of the Mount , facing Mecca . The Dome of the Rock currently sits in the middle , occupying or close to the area where the Holy Temple previously stood .   In light of the dual claims of both Judaism and Islam , it is one of the most contested religious sites in the world . Since the Crusades , the Muslim community of Jerusalem has managed the site as a Waqf , without interruption . As the site is part of the Old City , controlled by Israel since 1967 , both Israel and the Palestinian Authority claim sovereignty over it , and it remains a major focal point of the Arab -- Israeli conflict . In an attempt to keep the status quo , the Israeli government enforces a controversial ban on prayer by non-Muslims .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Iberia , centered on present-day Eastern Georgia , was bordered by Colchis in the west , Caucasian Albania in the east and Armenia in the south .   Its population , the Iberians , formed the nucleus of the Georgians ( Kartvelians ) . Iberia , ruled by Pharnavazid , Arsacid and Chosroid royal dynasties , together with Colchis to its west , would form the nucleus of the unified medieval Kingdom of Georgia under Bagrationi dynasty .   In the 4th century , after Christianization of Iberia by Saint Nino during the reign of King Mirian III Christiantity was made the state religion of the kingdom . Starting in the early 6th century AD , the kingdom 's position as a Sassanian vassal state was changed into effectively direct Persian rule . In 580 , king Hormizd IV ( 578-590 ) abolished the monarchy after the death of King Bakur III , and Iberia became a Persian province ruled by a marzpan ( governor ) .

53795,Birmingham is a suburban borough.,Birmingham,"Birmingham ( -LSB- ˈbɜːmɪŋəm -RSB- ) is a city and metropolitan borough in the West Midlands , England . It is the largest and most populous British city outside London , with a population of 1,101,360 in 2014 .   A medium-sized market town in the medieval period , Birmingham grew to international prominence in the 18th century at the heart of the Midlands Enlightenment and subsequent Industrial Revolution , which saw the town at the forefront of worldwide advances in science , technology , and economic development , producing a series of innovations that laid many of the foundations of modern industrial society . By 1791 it was being hailed as `` the first manufacturing town in the world '' . Birmingham 's distinctive economic profile , with thousands of small workshops practising a wide variety of specialised and highly skilled trades , encouraged exceptional levels of creativity and innovation and provided a diverse and resilient economic base for industrial prosperity that was to last into the final quarter of the 20th century . Perhaps the most important invention in British history , the industrial steam engine , was invented in Birmingham . Its resulting high level of social mobility also fostered a culture of broad-based political radicalism , that under leaders from Thomas Attwood to Joseph Chamberlain was to give it a political influence unparalleled in Britain outside London , and a pivotal role in the development of British democracy . From the summer of 1940 to the spring of 1943 , Birmingham was bombed heavily by the German Luftwaffe in what is known as the Birmingham Blitz . The damage done to the city 's infrastructure , in addition to a deliberate policy of demolition and new building by planners , led to extensive demolition and redevelopment in subsequent decades .   Today Birmingham 's economy is dominated by the service sector . The city is a major international commercial centre , ranked as a gamma + world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ; and an important transport , retail , events and conference hub . Its metropolitan economy is the second largest in the United Kingdom with a GDP of $ 121.1 bn ( 2014 ) , and its six universities make it the largest centre of higher education in the country outside London . Birmingham 's major cultural institutions -- including the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra , the Birmingham Royal Ballet , the Birmingham Repertory Theatre , the Library of Birmingham and the Barber Institute of Fine Arts -- enjoy international reputations , and the city has vibrant and influential grassroots art , music , literary and culinary scenes . Birmingham is the fourth-most visited city in the UK by foreign visitors .   Birmingham 's sporting heritage can be felt worldwide , with the concept of the Football League and lawn tennis both originating from the city . Its most successful football club Aston Villa has won seven league titles and one European Cup with the other professional club being Birmingham City .   People from Birmingham are called Brummies , a term derived from the city 's nickname of Brum . This originates from the city 's dialect name , Brummagem , which may in turn have been derived from one of the city 's earlier names , Bromwicham .

14879,The American Civil War took place in the 20th century.,American_Civil_War,"The American Civil War was fought in the United States from 1861 to 1865 . After a long standing controversy over slavery and state 's rights , war broke out in April 1861 , when Confederates attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina , shortly after Abraham Lincoln was elected . The nationalists of the Union proclaimed loyalty to the U.S. Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States of America advocating states ' rights to perpetual slavery and its expansion in the Americas .   Among the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states individually declared their secession from the U.S. to form the Confederate States of America . The Confederacy grew to include eleven states ; it claimed two more border states ( Kentucky and Missouri ) , the Indian Territory , and the southern portions of the Union 's western territories of Arizona and New Mexico , which was organized and incorporated into the Confederacy as Confederate Arizona . The Confederacy was never diplomatically recognized by the United States government , nor was it recognized by any foreign country ( although Britain and France granted it belligerent status ) . The states that remained loyal , including the border states where slavery was legal , were known as the Union or the North .   The North and South quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over four years . During this time many innovations in warfare occurred , including the development and use of iron-clad ships , ultimately changing naval strategy around the world . The Union finally won the war when General Robert E. Lee surrendered to General Ulysses S. Grant at the battle of Appomattox , which triggered a series of surrenders by Confederate generals throughout the southern states . Four years of intense combat left 620,000 to 750,000 soldiers dead , a higher number than the number of American military deaths in World War I and World War II combined , and much of the South 's infrastructure was destroyed . The Confederacy collapsed , slavery was abolished and 4 million slaves were freed . The Reconstruction Era ( 1863 -- 1877 ) overlapped and followed the war , with the process of restoring national unity , strengthening the national government , and granting civil rights to freed slaves throughout the country . The Civil War is arguably the most studied and written about episode in American history .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

131690,The Dodo has only been depicted with a red head.,Dodo,"The dodo ( Raphus cucullatus ) is an extinct flightless bird that was endemic to the island of Mauritius , east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean . The dodo 's closest genetic relative was the also extinct Rodrigues solitaire , the two forming the subfamily Raphinae of the family of pigeons and doves . The closest living relative of the dodo is the Nicobar pigeon . A white dodo was once thought to have existed on the nearby island of Réunion , but this is now thought to have been confusion based on the Réunion ibis and paintings of white dodos .   Subfossil remains show the dodo was about 1 m tall and may have weighed 10.6 - . The dodo 's appearance in life is evidenced only by drawings , paintings , and written accounts from the 17th century . Because these vary considerably , and because only some illustrations are known to have been drawn from live specimens , its exact appearance in life remains unresolved , and little is known about its behaviour . Though the dodo has historically been considered fat and clumsy , it is now thought to have been well-adapted for its ecosystem . It has been depicted with brownish-grey plumage , yellow feet , a tuft of tail feathers , a grey , naked head , and a black , yellow , and green beak . It used gizzard stones to help digest its food , which is thought to have included fruits , and its main habitat is believed to have been the woods in the drier coastal areas of Mauritius . One account states its clutch consisted of a single egg . It is presumed that the dodo became flightless because of the ready availability of abundant food sources and a relative absence of predators on Mauritius .   The first recorded mention of the dodo was by Dutch sailors in 1598 . In the following years , the bird was hunted by sailors and invasive species , while its habitat was being destroyed . The last widely accepted sighting of a dodo was in 1662 . Its extinction was not immediately noticed , and some considered it to be a mythical creature . In the 19th century , research was conducted on a small quantity of remains of four specimens that had been brought to Europe in the early 17th century . Among these is a dried head , the only soft tissue of the dodo that remains today . Since then , a large amount of subfossil material has been collected on Mauritius , mostly from the Mare aux Songes swamp . The extinction of the dodo within less than a century of its discovery called attention to the previously unrecognised problem of human involvement in the disappearance of entire species . The dodo achieved widespread recognition from its role in the story of Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland , and it has since become a fixture in popular culture , often as a symbol of extinction and obsolescence .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

51188,Minor League Baseball prepares players for the major leagues.,Minor_League_Baseball,"Minor League Baseball is a hierarchy of professional baseball leagues in the Americas that compete at levels below Major League Baseball ( MLB ) and provide opportunities for player development and a way to prepare for the major leagues . All of the minor leagues are operated as independent businesses . Most are members of the umbrella organization known as Minor League Baseball ( MiLB ) , which operates under the Commissioner of Baseball within the scope of organized baseball . Several leagues , known as independent baseball leagues , do not have any official links to Major League Baseball .   Except for the Mexican League , teams in the organized minor leagues are generally independently owned and operated but are directly affiliated with one major league team through a standardized Player Development Contract ( PDC ) . These leagues also go by the nicknames the `` farm system , '' `` farm club , '' or `` farm team ( s ) '' because of a joke passed around by major league players in the 1930s when St. Louis Cardinals general manager Branch Rickey formalized the system , and teams in small towns were `` growing players down on the farm like corn . ''   Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball teams may enter into a PDC for a two - or four-year term . At the expiration of a PDC term , teams may renew their affiliation , or sign new PDCs with different clubs , though many relationships are renewed and endure for extended time periods . For example , the Omaha Storm Chasers ( formerly the Omaha Royals and Omaha Golden Spikes ) have been the Triple-A affiliate of the Kansas City Royals since the Royals joined the American League in 1969 , but the Columbus Clippers changed affiliations , after being associated with the New York Yankees from 1979 , to the Washington Nationals in 2007 and have been affiliated with the Cleveland Indians since 2009 .   A few minor league teams are directly owned by their major league parent club , such as the Springfield Cardinals , owned by the St. Louis Cardinals , and all of the Atlanta Braves ' affiliates except the Florida Fire Frogs .

223291,The only woman to compete in the Baja 1000 was Danica Patrick.,Baja_1000,"The SCORE Baja 1000 is an off-road race that takes place in Mexico 's Baja California Peninsula . The 2016 SCORE Baja 1000 is the final round of a four-race series , previous events are the SCORE Desert Challenge , the SCORE San Felipe 250 & the SCORE Baja 500 . The 2016 round will be the 49th SCORE Baja 1000 , occurring from November 16 -- 20 over an 800-mile loop both starting and ending in Ensenada , Baja California , Mexico .   The Baja 1000 allows various types of vehicle classes to compete on the same course -- from such small and large bore motorcycles , stock Volkswagen , production vehicles , buggies , Trucks , and custom fabricated race vehicles . The course has remained relatively the same over the years , about every other being either a point-to-point race from Ensenada to La Paz , or a loop race starting and finishing in Ensenada .   The name of the event can be misleading as the mileage varies for the type of event ( `` Loop '' of 600 to 850 miles starting and finishing in Ensenada , or `` Point to Point '' also known as the 900 . The first official race started in Tijuana , Baja California , on October 31 , 1967 , and was named the NORRA Mexican 1000 Rally . The course length that year was 849 mi and ended in La Paz , Baja California Sur , with the overall winning time of 27 hours 38 minutes ( 27:38 ) set by Vic Wilson and Ted Mangels while driving a Meyers Manx buggy .   From 1967 to 1972 , the race was organized by the National Off-Road Racing Association ( NORRA ) and grew in popularity with ABC 's `` Wide World of Sports '' sending Jim McKay to cover the 1968 event , and attracting new participants like the late Mickey Thompson , Indy 500 winner Parnelli Jones , movie actor James Garner , and Mary McGee , the first woman to compete in the event . By 1971 , major sponsors such as Olympia Brewing Company and Minolta Cameras began to support Parnelli Jones in his Dick Russell designed and Bill Stroppe prepared `` Big Oly '' Bronco and Larry Minor in a similar Stroppe prepared Bronco .   In October 1973 , the price for a barrel of crude oil shot up 70 % overnight as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) launched the Arab Oil Embargo . Fearful competitors would abandon the idea of competing and stay home , NORRA abandoned the race -- despite assurances from the Federal government run Petroleos Mexicanos ( Pemex ) fuel prices would remain stable -- and announced they would hold an event in the state of Arizona .   It was at that time in history , Baja California governor Milton Castellanos handed over sanctioning of the event to a non-profit Mexican corporation called the `` Baja Sports Committee '' ( BSC ) . BSC renamed the event the `` Baja Mil '' ( Baja 1000 ) and scheduled the race to run on the original dates chosen by NORRA . Though NORRA held a competing event in the United States that same weekend , BSC successfully ran the race from Ensenada to La Paz like the years prior . Unaware of the challenges , BSC found promoting Baja races more difficult than anticipated . Instead of giving up the race , the Mexican government requested help from Southern California Off-Road Enterprises ( SCORE ) in hosting and promoting future Baja races . Through negotiations with Mickey Thompson and his SCORE organization , the Government agreed to give exclusive rights to SCORE to hold Baja races and also reluctantly allowed SCORE to cancel the event for 1974 ( a year where motorsport was curtailed in the United States because of the oil crisis ) . SCORE hired Sal Fish as president and took control of the Baja 1000 from that year on with the Baja 1000 race resuming under new control in 1975 . In 2012 , the racing organization was purchased by Roger Norman and continues to run under his presidency .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Taft was elected president in 1908 , the chosen successor of Theodore Roosevelt , but was defeated for re-election by Woodrow Wilson in 1912 after Roosevelt split the Republican vote by running as a third-party candidate . In 1921 , President Warren G. Harding appointed Taft to be chief justice , a position in which he served until a month before his death .   Taft was born in Cincinnati in 1857 . His father , Alphonso Taft , was a U.S. Attorney General and Secretary of War . William Taft attended Yale and was a member of Skull and Bones secret society like his father , and after becoming a lawyer was appointed a judge while still in his twenties .

In 1901 , President William McKinley appointed Taft civilian governor of the Philippines . In 1904 , Roosevelt made him Secretary of War , and he became Roosevelt 's hand-picked successor . Despite his personal ambition to become chief justice , Taft declined repeated offers of appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States , believing his political work to be more important .   With Roosevelt 's help , Taft had little opposition for the Republican nomination for president in 1908 , and easily defeated William Jennings Bryan for the presidency that November . In the White House , he focused on East Asia more than European affairs , and repeatedly intervened to prop up or remove Latin American governments . Taft sought reductions to trade tariffs , then a major source of governmental income , but the resulting bill was heavily influenced by special interests .

After leaving office , Taft returned to Yale as a professor , continuing his political activity and working against war through the League to Enforce Peace . In 1921 , President Harding appointed Taft as chief justice , an office he had long sought .

162741,Aeneas appeared in an ancient Egyptian epic poem by Homer.,Iliad,"The Iliad ( -LSB- ˈɪliəd -RSB- Ἰλιάς , -LSB- iː.li.ás -RSB- in Classical Attic ; sometimes referred to as the Song of Ilion or Song of Ilium ) is an ancient Greek epic poem in dactylic hexameter , traditionally attributed to Homer . Set during the Trojan War , the ten-year siege of the city of Troy ( Ilium ) by a coalition of Greek states , it tells of the battles and events during the weeks of a quarrel between King Agamemnon and the warrior Achilles .   Although the story covers only a few weeks in the final year of the war , the Iliad mentions or alludes to many of the Greek legends about the siege ; the earlier events , such as the gathering of warriors for the siege , the cause of the war , and related concerns tend to appear near the beginning . Then the epic narrative takes up events prophesied for the future , such as Achilles ' imminent death and the fall of Troy , although the narrative ends before these events take place . However , as these events are prefigured and alluded to more and more vividly , when it reaches an end the poem has told a more or less complete tale of the Trojan War .   The Iliad is paired with something of a sequel , the Odyssey , also attributed to Homer . Along with the Odyssey , the Iliad is among the oldest extant works of Western literature , and its written version is usually dated to around the 8th century BC . Recent statistical modelling based on language evolution gives a date of 760 -- 710 BC . In the modern vulgate ( the standard accepted version ) , the Iliad contains 15,693 lines ; it is written in Homeric Greek , a literary amalgam of Ionic Greek and other dialects .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

114739,Antigua and Barbuda was the birthplace of Christopher Columbus.,Christopher_Columbus,"Christopher Columbus ( Cristoforo Colombo -- 20 May 1506 ) was an Italian explorer , navigator , and colonizer . A citizen of the Republic of Genoa , under the auspices of the Catholic Monarchs of Spain he completed four voyages across the Atlantic Ocean . Those voyages and his efforts to establish permanent settlements on the island of Hispaniola initiated the European colonization of the New World .   At a time when European kingdoms were beginning to establish new trade routes and colonies , motivated by imperialism and economic competition , Columbus proposed to reach the East Indies by sailing westward . This eventually received the support of the Spanish Crown , which saw a chance to enter the spice trade with Asia through this new route . During his first voyage in 1492 , he reached the New World instead of arriving at Japan as he had intended , landing on an island in the Bahamas archipelago that he named `` San Salvador '' . Over the course of three more voyages , he visited the Greater and Lesser Antilles , as well as the Caribbean coast of Venezuela and Central America , claiming all of it for the Crown of Castile .   Columbus was not the first European explorer to reach the Americas , having been preceded by the Viking expedition led by Leif Erikson in the 11th century , but his voyages led to the first lasting European contact with the Americas , inaugurating a period of exploration , conquest , and colonization that lasted several centuries . These voyages thus had an enormous effect on the historical development of the modern Western world . He spearheaded the transatlantic slave trade and has been accused by several historians of initiating the genocide of the Hispaniola natives . Columbus himself saw his accomplishments primarily in the light of spreading the Christian religion .   Columbus never admitted that he had reached a continent previously unknown to Europeans , rather than the East Indies for which he had set course . He called the inhabitants of the lands that he visited indios ( Spanish for `` Indians '' ) . His strained relationship with the Spanish crown and its appointed colonial administrators in America led to his arrest and dismissal as governor of the settlements on the island of Hispaniola in 1500 , and later to protracted litigation over the benefits that he and his heirs claimed were owed to them by the crown .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

163820,William Blackstone has no education.,William_Blackstone,"Sir William Blackstone ( 10 July 1723 -- 14 February 1780 ) was an English jurist , judge and Tory politician of the eighteenth century . He is most noted for writing the Commentaries on the Laws of England . Born into a middle-class family in London , Blackstone was educated at Charterhouse School before matriculating at Pembroke College , Oxford in 1738 . After switching to and completing a Bachelor of Civil Law degree , he was made a Fellow of All Souls , Oxford on 2 November 1743 , admitted to Middle Temple , and called to the Bar there in 1746 . Following a slow start to his career as a barrister , Blackstone became heavily involved in university administration , becoming accountant , treasurer and bursar on 28 November 1746 and Senior Bursar in 1750 . Blackstone is considered responsible for completing the Codrington Library and Warton Building , and simplifying the complex accounting system used by the college . On 3 July 1753 he formally gave up his practice as a barrister and instead embarked on a series of lectures on English law , the first of their kind . These were massively successful , earning him a total of # 453 ( # in terms ) , and led to the publication of An Analysis of the Laws of England in 1756 , which repeatedly sold out and was used to preface his later works .   On 20 October 1758 Blackstone was confirmed as the first Vinerian Professor of English Law , immediately embarking on another series of lectures and publishing a similarly successful second treatise , titled A Discourse on the Study of the Law . With his growing fame , Blackstone successfully returned to the bar and maintained a good practice , also securing election as Tory Member of Parliament for the rotten borough of Hindon on 30 March 1761 . In November 1765 he published the first of four volumes of Commentaries on the Laws of England , considered his magnum opus ; the completed work earned Blackstone # 14,000 ( # in terms ) . After repeated failures , he successfully gained appointment to the judiciary as a Justice of the Court of King 's Bench on 16 February 1770 , leaving to replace Edward Clive as a Justice of the Common Pleas on 25 June . He remained in this position until his death , on 14 February 1780 .   Blackstone 's legacy and main work of note is his Commentaries . Designed to provide a complete overview of English law , the four-volume treatise was repeatedly republished in 1770 , 1773 , 1774 , 1775 , 1778 and in a posthumous edition in 1783 . Reprints of the first edition , intended for practical use rather than antiquary interest , were published until the 1870s in England and Wales , and a working version by Henry John Stephen , first published in 1841 , was reprinted until after the Second World War . Legal education in England had stalled ; Blackstone 's work gave the law `` at least a veneer of scholarly respectability '' . William Searle Holdsworth , one of Blackstone 's successors as Vinerian Professor , argued that `` If the Commentaries had not been written when they were written , I think it very doubtful that -LSB- the United States -RSB- , and other English speaking countries would have so universally adopted the common law . '' In the United States , the Commentaries influenced Alexander Hamilton , John Marshall , James Wilson , John Jay , John Adams , James Kent and Abraham Lincoln , and remain frequently cited in Supreme Court decisions .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

During the mid-18th century , Bombay was reshaped by the Hornby Vellard project , which undertook reclamation of the area between the seven islands from the sea . Along with construction of major roads and railways , the reclamation project , completed in 1845 , transformed Bombay into a major seaport on the Arabian Sea . Bombay in the 19th century was characterised by economic and educational development . During the early 20th century it became a strong base for the Indian independence movement . Upon India 's independence in 1947 the city was incorporated into Bombay State . In 1960 , following the Samyukta Maharashtra movement , a new state of Maharashtra was created with Bombay as the capital .   Mumbai is the financial , commercial and entertainment capital of India . It is also one of the world 's top ten centres of commerce in terms of global financial flow , generating 6.16 % of India 's GDP and accounting for 25 % of industrial output , 70 % of maritime trade in India ( Mumbai Port Trust and JNPT ) , and 70 % of capital transactions to India 's economy . The city houses important financial institutions such as the Reserve Bank of India , the Bombay Stock Exchange , the National Stock Exchange of India , the SEBI and the corporate headquarters of numerous Indian companies and multinational corporations . It is also home to some of India 's premier scientific and nuclear institutes like BARC , NPCL , IREL , TIFR , AERB , AECI , and the Department of Atomic Energy . The city also houses India 's Hindi ( Bollywood ) and Marathi film and television industry . Mumbai 's business opportunities , as well as its potential to offer a higher standard of living , attract migrants from all over India , making the city a melting pot of many communities and cultures .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

220447,The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints declined to ever set a Sabbath.,Sabbath_in_Christianity,"Sabbath in Christianity is the inclusion or adoption in Christianity of a Sabbath day . Established within Judaism through Mosaic Law , Christians inherited a Sabbath practice that reflected two great precepts : the commandment to `` remember the sabbath day , to keep it holy '' and God 's blessing of the seventh day ( Saturday ) as a day of rest in the Genesis creation narrative . The first of these provisions was associated in Judaism with the assembly of the people to worship in the Temple in Jerusalem or in synagogues .   The position now dominant in Western Christianity is that observance of the Lord 's Day , Sunday , supplanted or superseded the Sabbath commandment in that the former `` celebrated the Christian community 's deliverance from captivity to sin , Satan , and worldly passions , made possible by the resurrection on the first day of the week . '' Early Christians observed the seventh day with prayer and rest , but they also gathered on the first day . By the 4th century , Christians were officially observing the first day , Sunday , as their day of rest , not the seventh .   Beginning about the 17th century , a few groups of Protestants arose to take issue with some of the practice of the churches around them , sometimes also questioning the theology that had been so widely accepted throughout 16 centuries . Mostly Sabbatarians , they broke away from their former churches to form communities that followed Sabbath-based practices that differed from the rest of Christianity , often also adopting a more literal interpretation of law , either Christian or Mosaic .   A sabbatarian movement within Oriental Orthodoxy began in the 12th century in Ethiopia and gained momentum in the 13th , eventually establishing itself as the norm in that region . The modern Orthodox Tewahedo churches observe a `` two-day Sabbath '' , including both Saturday and Sunday .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Designed as a smaller wide-body airliner than earlier aircraft such as the 747 , the 767 has seating capacity for 181 to 375 people , and a design range of 3850 to , depending on variant . Development of the 767 occurred in tandem with a narrow-body twinjet , the 757 , resulting in shared design features which allow pilots to obtain a common type rating to operate both aircraft .   The 767 is produced in three fuselage lengths . The original 767-200 entered service in 1982 , followed by the 767-300 in 1986 and the 767-400ER , an extended-range ( ER ) variant , in 2000 .

There are an estimated one million Roma in the United States ; and 800,000 in Brazil , most of whose ancestors emigrated in the nineteenth century from eastern Europe . Brazil also includes some Romani descended from people deported by the government of Portugal during the Inquisition in the colonial era . In migrations since the late nineteenth century , Romani have also moved to other countries in South America and to Canada .   In February 2016 , during the International Roma Conference , the Indian Minister of External Affairs stated that the people of the Roma community were children of India . The conference ended with a recommendation to the Government of India to recognize the Roma community spread across 30 countries as a part of the Indian diaspora .   The Romani language is divided into several dialects , which add up to an estimated number of speakers larger than two million . The total number of Romani people is at least twice as large ( several times as large according to high estimates ) . Many Romani are native speakers of the language current in their country of residence , or of mixed languages combining the two ; those varieties are sometimes called Para-Romani .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

It came into existence after World War I in 1918 under the name of the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes by the merger of the provisional State of Slovenes , Croats and Serbs ( itself formed from territories of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire ) with the formerly independent Kingdom of Serbia . The Serbian royal House of Karađorđević became the Yugoslav royal dynasty . Yugoslavia gained international recognition on 13 July 1922 at the Conference of Ambassadors in Paris . The country was named after the South Slavic peoples and constituted their first union , following centuries in which the territories had been part of the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary .   Renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia on 3 October 1929 , it was invaded by the Axis powers on 6 April 1941 . In 1943 , a Democratic Federal Yugoslavia was proclaimed by the Partisan resistance . In 1944 , the king recognised it as the legitimate government , but in November 1945 the monarchy was abolished . Yugoslavia was renamed the Federal People 's Republic of Yugoslavia in 1946 , when a communist government was established . It acquired the territories of Istria , Rijeka , and Zadar from Italy . Partisan leader Josip Broz Tito ruled the country as president until his death in 1980 . In 1963 , the country was renamed again as the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( SFRY ) .   The constituent six socialist republics that made up the country were the SR Bosnia and Herzegovina , SR Croatia , SR Macedonia , SR Montenegro , SR Serbia , and SR Slovenia . Serbia contained two Socialist Autonomous Provinces , Vojvodina and Kosovo , which after 1974 were largely equal to the other members of the federation . After an economic and political crisis in the 1980s and the rise of nationalism , Yugoslavia broke up along its republics ' borders , at first into five countries , leading to the Yugoslav Wars .   After the breakup , the republics of Serbia and Montenegro formed a reduced federation , the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( FRY ) , which aspired to the status of sole legal successor to the SFRY , but those claims were opposed by the other former republics . Eventually , Serbia and Montenegro accepted the opinion of the Badinter Arbitration Committee about shared succession . Serbia and Montenegro themselves broke up in 2006 and became independent states , while Kosovo proclaimed independence in 2008 .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

This is commonplace in association football stadiums in nations such as the United Kingdom , Spain , and the Netherlands . Most association football ( soccer ) , American football stadiums in the United States and Canadian Football League stadiums in Canada are all-seaters , as are most baseball and track and field stadiums in those countries . A stadium that is not an all-seater has areas for attendees holding standing-room only tickets to stand and view the proceedings . Such standing areas were known as terraces in Britain . Stands with only terraces used to dominate the football attendance in the UK . For instance , the South Bank Stand behind the southern goal at Molineux Stadium , Wolverhampton , home of Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. , had a maximum of 32,000 standing attenders , while the rest of the stadium hosted a little bit less than that ( total maximum attendance was around 59,000 ) .   Some European countries , such as Germany , do not have all-seater stadiums . German fans expressed a preference to stand while watching football , so the country 's grounds have large terraced areas . For instance , Borussia Dortmund 's Westfalenstadion ( commercially known as Signal Iduna Park ) has an all-seated capacity of 65,829 , but during Bundesliga games the attendance limit is set to 81,360 .

Although his mainstream career spanned only four years , he is widely regarded as one of the most influential electric guitarists in the history of popular music , and one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century . The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as `` arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music '' .   Born in Seattle , Washington , Hendrix began playing guitar at the age of 15 . In 1961 , he enlisted in the U.S. Army and trained as a paratrooper in the 101st Airborne Division ; he was granted an honorable discharge the following year . Soon afterward , he moved to Clarksville , Tennessee , and began playing gigs on the Chitlin ' Circuit , earning a place in the Isley Brothers ' backing band and later with Little Richard , with whom he continued to work through mid-1965 . He then played with Curtis Knight and the Squires before moving to England in late 1966 after being discovered by Linda Keith , who in turn interested bassist Chas Chandler of the Animals in becoming his first manager . Within months , Hendrix had earned three UK top ten hits with the Jimi Hendrix Experience : `` Hey Joe '' , `` Purple Haze '' , and `` The Wind Cries Mary '' . He achieved fame in the U.S. after his performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967 , and in 1968 his third and final studio album , Electric Ladyland , reached number one in the U.S. ; it was Hendrix 's most commercially successful release and his first and only number one album . The world 's highest-paid performer , he headlined the Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970 before his accidental death from barbiturate-related asphyxia on September 18 , 1970 , at the age of 27 .   Hendrix was inspired musically by American rock and roll and electric blues . He favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain , and was instrumental in utilizing the previously undesirable sounds caused by guitar amplifier feedback . He helped to popularize the use of a wah-wah pedal in mainstream rock , and was the first artist to use stereophonic phasing effects in music recordings . Holly George-Warren of Rolling Stone commented : `` Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source . Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion , but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled , fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began . ''   Hendrix was the recipient of several music awards during his lifetime and posthumously . In 1967 , readers of Melody Maker voted him the Pop Musician of the Year , and in 1968 , Rolling Stone declared him the Performer of the Year . Disc and Music Echo honored him with the World Top Musician of 1969 and in 1970 , Guitar Player named him the Rock Guitarist of the Year . The Jimi Hendrix Experience was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005 .

He was the last French monarch of the Valois dynasty .   As the fourth son of King Henry II of France and Catherine de ' Medici , Henry was not expected to assume the throne of France . He was thus a good candidate for the vacant Commonwealth throne , and he was elected with the dual titles King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania .   Henry 's rule over the Commonwealth was brief , but notable . The Henrician Articles he signed into law accepting the Commonwealth throne established Poland as an elective monarchy subject to free election by the Polish nobility . Of his three older brothers , two would live long enough to ascend the French throne , but both died young and without a legitimate male heir . He abandoned Commonwealth upon receiving word that he had inherited the throne of France at the age of 22 .   The kingdom of France was at the time plagued by the Wars of Religion , and Henry 's authority was undermined by violent political parties funded by foreign powers : the Catholic League ( supported by Spain ) , the Protestant Huguenots ( supported by England and the Dutch ) and the Malcontents , led by Henry 's own brother , the Duke of Alençon , which was a party of Catholic and Protestant aristocrats who jointly opposed the absolutist ambitions of the king . Henry III was himself a politique , arguing that a strong and religiously tolerant monarchy would save France from collapse .   After the death of Henry 's younger brother Francis , Duke of Anjou , and when it became apparent that Henry would not produce an heir , the Wars of Religion grew into a succession crisis that resulted in a war known as the War of the Three Henrys . Henry III 's legitimate heir was his distant cousin Henry , King of Navarre , a Protestant . The Catholic League , led by Henry I , Duke of Guise , sought to exclude Protestants from the succession and championed the Catholic Charles , Cardinal of Bourbon , as Henry III 's heir .   In 1589 , Jacques Clément , a Catholic fanatic , murdered Henry III , who was succeeded by the King of Navarre who , as Henry IV , would assume the throne of France after converting to Catholicism , and become the first French king of the House of Bourbon .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ
217166,The Pakistan Movement was the result of a series of transformations in Pakistan.,Pakistan_Movement,"The Pakistan Movement or Tehrik-e-Pakistan ( -LSB- -- ) was a religious political movement in the 1940s that aimed for and succeeded in the creation of Pakistan from the Muslim-majority areas of British Indian Empire .   The movement progressed within India alongside the Indian independence movement , but the Pakistan Movement sought to establish a new nation-state that protected the religious identity and political interests of Muslims in South Asia . The first organised political movements were in Aligarh where another literary movement was led by Sir Syed Ahmad Khan that built the genesis of the Pakistan movement . An educational convention held in 1906 with joint efforts of Syed Ahmad Khan and Vikar-ul-Haq , the Muslim reformers took the movement to the political stage in the form of establishing the mainstream and then newly formed All-India Muslim League ( AIML ) , with prominent moderate leaders seeking to protect the basic rights of Muslims in the British Raj . During the initial stages of the movement , it adopted the vision of philosopher Iqbal after addressing at the convention of the AIML 's annual session . Muhammad Ali Jinnah 's constitutional struggle further helped gaining public support for the movement in the four provinces . Urdu poets such as Iqbal and Faiz used literature , poetry and speech as a powerful tool for political awareness . Feminists such as Sheila Pant and Fatima Jinnah championed the emancipation of Pakistan 's women and their participation in national politics .   The Pakistan Movement was led by a large and diversified group of people whose struggle ultimately resulted in the British Empire announcing the Indian Independence Act 1947 , which created the independent dominions of India and Pakistan . The Pakistan Movement was the result of a series of social , political , and intellectual transformations in Pakistani society , government , and ways of thinking . Efforts and struggles of the Founding Fathers resulted in the creation of the democratic and independent government . In the following years , another nationally -- minded subset went on to established a strong government , followed by the military intervention in 1958 . Grievousness and unbalanced economic distribution caused an upheaval which led East Pakistan to declare independence as the People 's Republic of Bangladesh in 1971 . After a strong concessions and consents reached in 1973 , the new Constitution established a relatively strong government , institutions , national courts , a legislature that represented both states in the Senate and population in the National Assembly . Pakistan 's phase shift to republicanism , and the gradually increasing democracy , caused an upheaval of traditional social hierarchy and gave birth to the ethic that has formed a core of political values in Pakistan .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

144130,Zoe Saldana has always been banned from America.,Star_Trek_(film),"Star Trek is a 2009 American science fiction adventure film directed by J. J. Abrams and written by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman . It is the eleventh film in the Star Trek film franchise , and is also a reboot that features the main characters of the original Star Trek television series portrayed by a new cast , as the first in the rebooted film series . The film follows James T. Kirk ( Chris Pine ) and Spock ( Zachary Quinto ) aboard USS Enterprise as they combat Nero ( Eric Bana ) , a Romulan from their future who threatens the United Federation of Planets . The story takes place in an alternate reality because of time travel by both Nero and the original Spock ( Leonard Nimoy ) . The alternate timeline was created in an attempt to free the film and the franchise from established continuity constraints while simultaneously preserving original story elements .   The idea for a prequel film which would follow the Star Trek characters during their time in Starfleet Academy was discussed by series creator Gene Roddenberry in 1968 . The concept resurfaced in the late 1980s , when it was postulated by Harve Bennett as a possible plotline for what would become Star Trek VI : The Undiscovered Country , but was rejected in lieu of other projects by Roddenberry . Following the critical and commercial failure of Star Trek : Nemesis and the cancellation of the television series Star Trek : Enterprise , the franchise 's executive producer Rick Berman and screenwriter Erik Jendresen wrote an unproduced film titled Star Trek : The Beginning , which would take place after Enterprise . After the separation of Viacom and CBS Corporation in 2005 , former Paramount Pictures president Gail Berman convinced CBS to allow Paramount to produce a new film in the franchise . Orci and Kurtzman , both fans of Star Trek , were approached to write the film , and J. J. Abrams was approached to direct it .

Industrial Light & Magic used digital ships for the film , as opposed to the previous films in the franchise . Production for the film concluded by the end of 2008 .   Star Trek was heavily promoted in the months preceding its release ; pre-release screenings for the film premiered in select cities around the world , including Austin , Texas , Sydney , Australia , and Calgary , Alberta . It was released in the United States and Canada on May 8 , 2009 , to critical acclaim ; critics praised its character development , as well as its storyline , effects , stunts , action sequences , direction , and its score by Michael Giacchino . Star Trek was a box office success , grossing over $ 385.7 million worldwide against its $ 150 million production budget . It was nominated for several awards , including four Academy Awards at the 82nd Academy Awards , ultimately winning Best Makeup , making it the first Star Trek film to win an Academy Award .

218112,The Indian National Congress was founded during a foreign rule.,Indian_National_Congress,"The Indian National Congress ( INC , often called Congress ) is a broad-based political party in India . Founded in 1885 , the Congress led India to independence from Great Britain , and powerfully influenced other anti-colonial nationalist movements in the British Empire . After India 's independence in 1947 , the Congress formed the government at center in most instances , and also many regional state governments . The Congress is a secular , left-of-centre , party . Although it did not fare well in the last general elections in India in 2014 , it remains one of two major , nationwide , political parties in India , along with the right-wing , Hindu nationalist , Bhartiya Janata Party ( BJP ) .   The Congress was the first modern nationalist movement to emerge in the British Empire in Asia and Africa . It was founded in Bombay in late December 1885 , during the British Raj in India . Its principal founders were , Allan Octavian Hume ( a former administrator of Etawah district , North-Western Provinces , and pioneering ornithologist of India ) , as well as William Wedderburn , Pherozeshah Mehta , Dadabhai Naoroji , Dinshaw Wacha , and others . From the late 19th-century , and especially after 1920 , under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi , Congress became the principal leader of the Indian independence movement , with over 15 million members and over 70 million participants .   After independence in 1947 , Congress became India 's dominant political party ; , in the 15 general elections since independence , it has won an outright majority on six occasions and has led the ruling coalition a further four times , heading the central government for 49 years . There have been seven Congress Prime Ministers , the first being Jawaharlal Nehru ( 1947 -- 64 ) , and the most recent Manmohan Singh ( 2004 -- 14 ) . The party 's social liberal platform is generally considered to be on the centre-left of Indian politics .   From 2004 to 2014 , the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance , a coalition of several regional parties , formed the Indian government and was headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh . As of March 2017 , the party is in power in five states : Punjab , Himachal Pradesh , Karnataka , Meghalaya and Mizoram . In Bihar , it is a part of the ruling coalition . The Congress has previously directly ruled Andhra Pradesh , Tamil Nadu , Gujarat , Madhya Pradesh , Rajasthan , Uttar Pradesh and Goa . In the 2014 general election , the Congress had its poorest post-independence general election performance , winning only 44 seats of the 543-member house .   The Congress ' social policy is based upon the Gandhian principle of Sarvodaya -- the lifting up of all sections of society -- which involves the improvement of the lives of economically underprivileged and socially marginalised people . The party primarily endorses social liberalism -- seeking to balance individual liberty and social justice , and secularism -- asserting the right to be free from religious rule and teachings .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

In addition , numerous literary and scientific fragments , more than 10,000 letters , and nearly 3,000 drawings by him exist .

He was an early participant in the Sturm und Drang literary movement . During his first ten years in Weimar , Goethe was a member of the Duke 's privy council , sat on the war and highway commissions , oversaw the reopening of silver mines in nearby Ilmenau , and implemented a series of administrative reforms at the University of Jena .

36844,Watchmen explores the superhero genre through a dark satirical and dystopian lens.,Watchmen_(film),"Watchmen is a 2009 American superhero film directed by Zack Snyder , based on the 1986 -- 87 DC Comics limited series of the same name by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons . It stars an ensemble cast of Malin Åkerman , Billy Crudup , Matthew Goode , Carla Gugino , Jackie Earle Haley , Jeffrey Dean Morgan , and Patrick Wilson . A dark satirical and dystopian take on the superhero genre , the film is set in an alternate history in the year 1985 at the height of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union , as a group of mostly retired American superheroes investigates the murder of one of their own before uncovering an elaborate and deadly conspiracy , while their moral limitations are challenged by the complex nature of the circumstances .   From October 1987 until October 2005 , a live-action film adaptation of the Watchmen series became stranded in development hell ; producer Lawrence Gordon began developing the project at 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros. , the parent company of Watchmen publisher DC Comics , with producer Joel Silver and director Terry Gilliam , with the latter eventually deeming the complex comic `` un-filmable '' . During the 2000s , Gordon and Lloyd Levin collaborated with Universal Studios and Paramount Pictures to produce a script by David Hayter ; Darren Aronofsky and Paul Greengrass were also attached to the project before it was cancelled over budget disputes ; and in October 2005 , the project returned to Warner Bros. , where Snyder was hired to direct ; Paramount remained as its international distributor whereas Warner Bros. would distribute the film in the United States . However , Fox sued Warner Bros. for copyright violation arising from Gordon 's failure to pay a buy-out in 1991 , which enabled him to develop the film at the other studios . Fox and Warner Bros. settled this before the film 's release , with Fox receiving a portion of the gross . Principal photography began in Vancouver , September 2007 . As with his previous film 300 , Snyder closely modelled his storyboards on the comic , but chose not to shoot all of Watchmen using green screens and opted for real sets instead .   Following its world premiere at Odeon Leicester Square on February 23 , 2009 , the film was released in both conventional and IMAX theaters on March 6 , 2009 , and grossed $ 55 million on its opening weekend and over $ 185 million at the worldwide box office . The film 's reception has been very polarized , with many critics voicing strong negative views and vice versa . A DVD based on elements of the Watchmen universe was released , including an animated adaptation of the comic Tales of the Black Freighter within the story starring Gerard Butler , and the fictional biography Under the Hood , detailing the older generation of superheroes from the film 's back-story . A director 's cut with 24 minutes of additional footage was released in July 2009 . The `` Ultimate Cut '' edition incorporated the animated comic Tales of the Black Freighter into the narrative as it was in the original graphic novel , lengthening the runtime to 3 hours and 35 minutes , and was released on November 3 , 2009 .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ
106966,Aphrodite appears in Greek mythology.,Aphrodite_Pandemos,"Aphrodite Pandemos ( Πάνδημος `` common to all the people '' ) , occurs as an epithet of the Greek goddess Aphrodite , and that in a twofold sense , first describing her as the goddess of low sensual pleasures as Venus vulgivaga or popularis , in opposition to Aphrodite Urania , or `` the heavenly Aphrodite '' . She was represented at Elis by Scopas riding on a ram . The second sense is that of Aphrodite uniting all the inhabitants of a country into one social or political body . In this respect she was worshipped at Athens along with Peitho ( persuasion ) , and her worship was said to have been instituted by Theseus at the time when he united the scattered townships into one great body of citizens . According to some authorities , it was Solon who erected the sanctuary of Aphrodite Pandemos , either because her image stood in the agora , or because the hetaerae had to pay the costs of its erection . The worship of Aphrodite Pandemos also occurs at Megalopolis in Arcadia , and at Thebes . A festival in honour of her is mentioned by Athenaeus . The sacrifices offered to her consisted of white goats . Pandemos occurs also as a surname of Eros .   The goddess riding on a goat was also known as Aphrodite Epitragia , `` from a she-goat '' . According to Plutarch , she acquired this epithet from an episode in the life of Theseus when , by the recommendation of Apollo , the hero sacrificed a goat to Aphrodite before departing for Crete in hopes that she would guide him on his voyage . As Theseus sacrificed the customary she-goat , the animal was suddenly transformed into a male goat .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

57670,Benzodiazepine was globally the least prescribed medication in 1977.,Benzodiazepine,"Benzodiazepines ( BZD , BZs ) , sometimes called `` benzos '' , are a class of psychoactive drugs whose core chemical structure is the fusion of a benzene ring and a diazepine ring . The first such drug , chlordiazepoxide ( Librium ) , was discovered accidentally by Leo Sternbach in 1955 , and made available in 1960 by Hoffmann -- La Roche , which , since 1963 , has also marketed the benzodiazepine diazepam ( Valium ) . In 1977 benzodiazepines were globally the most prescribed medications .   Benzodiazepines enhance the effect of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) at the GABAA receptor , resulting in sedative , hypnotic ( sleep-inducing ) , anxiolytic ( anti-anxiety ) , anticonvulsant , and muscle relaxant properties . High doses of many shorter-acting benzodiazepines may also cause anterograde amnesia and dissociation . These properties make benzodiazepines useful in treating anxiety , insomnia , agitation , seizures , muscle spasms , alcohol withdrawal and as a premedication for medical or dental procedures . Benzodiazepines are categorized as either short - , intermediate - , or long-acting . Short - and intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred for the treatment of insomnia ; longer-acting benzodiazepines are recommended for the treatment of anxiety .   Benzodiazepines are generally viewed as safe and effective for short-term use , although cognitive impairment and paradoxical effects such as aggression or behavioral disinhibition occasionally occur . A minority of people can have paradoxical reactions such as worsened agitation or panic . Long-term use is controversial because of concerns about adverse psychological and physical effects , decreasing effectiveness , and physical dependence and withdrawal . As a result of adverse effects associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines , withdrawal from benzodiazepines , in general , leads to improved physical and mental health . The elderly are at an increased risk of suffering from both short - and long-term adverse effects , and as a result , all benzodiazepines are listed in the Beers List of inappropriate medications for older adults .   There is controversy concerning the safety of benzodiazepines in pregnancy . While they are not major teratogens , uncertainty remains as to whether they cause cleft palate in a small number of babies and whether neurobehavioural effects occur as a result of prenatal exposure ; they are known to cause withdrawal symptoms in the newborn . Benzodiazepines can be taken in overdoses and can cause dangerous deep unconsciousness . However , they are less toxic than their predecessors , the barbiturates , and death rarely results when a benzodiazepine is the only drug taken . When combined with other central nervous system ( CNS ) depressants such as alcoholic drinks and opioids , the potential for toxicity and fatal overdose increases . Benzodiazepines are commonly misused and taken in combination with other drugs of abuse .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

37739,The atomic number for moscovium is 115.,Moscovium,"Moscovium is a superheavy synthetic element with symbol Mc and atomic number 115 . It was first synthesized in 2003 by a joint team of Russian and American scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research ( JINR ) in Dubna , Russia . In December 2015 , it was recognized as one of four new elements by the Joint Working Party of international scientific bodies IUPAC and IUPAP . On 28 November 2016 , it was officially named after the Moscow region , which the JINR is situated in .   Moscovium is an extremely radioactive element : its most stable known isotope , moscovium-290 , has a half-life of only 0.8 seconds . In the periodic table , it is a p-block transactinide element . It is a member of the 7th period and is placed in group 15 as the heaviest pnictogen , although it has not been confirmed to behave as a heavier homologue of the pnictogen bismuth . Moscovium is calculated to have some properties similar to its lighter homologues , nitrogen , phosphorus , arsenic , antimony , and bismuth , and to be a post-transition metal , although it should also show several major differences from them . About 100 atoms of moscovium have been observed to date , all of which have been shown to have mass numbers from 287 to 290 .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

The film 's screenplay was written by Roald Dahl , and loosely based on Ian Fleming 's 1964 novel of the same name . It is the first James Bond film to discard most of Fleming 's plot , using only a few characters and locations from the book as the background for an entirely new story .   In the film , Bond is dispatched to Japan after American and Soviet manned spacecraft disappear mysteriously in orbit . With each nation blaming the other amidst the Cold War , Bond travels secretly to a remote Japanese island to find the perpetrators and comes face to face with Ernst Stavro Blofeld , the head of SPECTRE . The film reveals the appearance of Blofeld , who was previously a partially unseen character . SPECTRE is working for the government of an unnamed Asian power , implied to be the People 's Republic of China , to provoke war between the superpowers .   During the filming in Japan , it was announced that Sean Connery would retire from the role of Bond , but after a hiatus , he returned in 1971 's Diamonds Are Forever and later 1983 's non-Eon Bond film Never Say Never Again . You Only Live Twice is the first Bond film to be directed by Lewis Gilbert , who later directed the 1977 film The Spy Who Loved Me and the 1979 film Moonraker , both starring Roger Moore .   You Only Live Twice was a great success , receiving positive reviews and grossing over $ 111 million in worldwide box office .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

It is bordered to the north by the Gulf of Finland , to the west by the Baltic Sea , to the south by Latvia ( 343 km ) , and to the east by Lake Peipus and Russia ( 338.6 km ) . Across the Baltic Sea lies Sweden in the west and Finland in the north . The territory of Estonia consists of a mainland and 2,222 islands and islets in the Baltic Sea , covering 45339 km2 of land and water , and is influenced by a humid continental climate .   The territory of Estonia has been inhabited since at least 6500 BC , with Finno-Ugric speakers -- the linguistic ancestors of modern Estonians -- arriving no later than around 1800 BC . Following centuries of successive German , Danish , Swedish , and Russian rule , Estonians experienced a national awakening that culminated in independence from the Russian Empire towards the end of World War I . During World War II , Estonia was occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940 , then by Nazi Germany a year later and was again annexed by the Soviets in 1944 , after which it was reconstituted as the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic . In 1988 , during the Singing Revolution , the Estonian Supreme Soviet issued the Estonian Sovereignty Declaration in defiance of Soviet rule , and independence was restored on 20 August 1991 .   Estonia is a democratic parliamentary republic divided into fifteen counties . Its capital and largest city is Tallinn . With a population of 1.3 million , it is one of the least-populous member states of the European Union , Eurozone , North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , OECD and Schengen Area .   Ethnic Estonians are a Finnic people , sharing close cultural ties with their northern neighbour , Finland , and the official language , Estonian , is a Finno-Ugric language closely related to Finnish and the Sami languages , and distantly to Hungarian .   Estonia is a developed country with an advanced , high-income economy that is among the fastest growing in the EU . Its Human Development Index ranks very highly , and it performs favourably in measurements of economic freedom , civil liberties and press freedom ( 3rd in the world in 2012 and 2007 ) . The 2015 PISA test places Estonian high school students 3rd in the world , behind Singapore and Japan .   Citizens of Estonia are provided with universal health care , free education and the longest paid maternity leave in the OECD . Since independence the country has rapidly developed its IT sector , becoming one of the world 's most digitally advanced societies .

138095,The Visigoths were always followers of Arianism.,Visigoths,"The Visigoths ( UK : -LSB- ˈvɪzɪˌɡɒθs -RSB- US : -LSB- ˈvɪzɪˌɡɑːθs -RSB- Visigothi , Wisigothi , Vesi , Visi , Wesi , or Wisi Visigoti ) were the western branches of the nomadic tribes of Germanic peoples referred to collectively as the Goths . These tribes flourished and spread throughout the late Roman Empire in Late Antiquity , or what is known as the Migration Period . The Visigoths emerged from earlier Gothic groups ( possibly the Thervingi ) who had invaded the Roman Empire beginning in 376 and had defeated the Romans at the Battle of Adrianople in 378 . Relations between the Romans and the Visigoths were variable , alternately warring with one another and making treaties when convenient . The Visigoths invaded Italy under Alaric I and sacked Rome in 410 . After the Visigoths sacked Rome , they began settling down , first in southern Gaul and eventually in Spain and Portugal , where they founded the Visigothic Kingdom and maintained a presence from the 5th to the 8th centuries AD .   The Visigoths first settled in southern Gaul as foederati of the Romans -- a relationship established in 418 . However , they soon fell out with their Roman hosts ( for reasons that are now obscure ) and established their own kingdom with its capital at Toulouse . They next extended their authority into Hispania at the expense of the Suebi and Vandals . In 507 , however , their rule in Gaul was ended by the Franks under Clovis I , who defeated them in the Battle of Vouillé . After that , the Visigoth kingdom was limited to Hispania , and they never again held territory north of the Pyrenees other than Septimania . A small , elite group of Visigoths came to dominate the governance of that region at the expense of those who had previously ruled there , particularly in the Byzantine province of Spania and the Kingdom of the Suebi .   In or around 589 , the Visigoths under Reccared I converted from Arianism to Nicene Christianity , gradually adopting the culture of their Hispano-Roman subjects . Their legal code , the Visigothic Code ( completed in 654 ) abolished the longstanding practice of applying different laws for Romans and Visigoths . Once legal distinctions were no longer being made between Romani and Gothi , they became known collectively as Hispani . In the century that followed , the region was dominated by the Councils of Toledo and the episcopacy . ( Little else is known about the Visigoths ' history during the 7th century , since records are relatively sparse . ) In 711 or 712 , a force of invading African Moors defeated the Visigoths in the Battle of Guadalete . Their king and many members of their governing elite were killed , and their kingdom rapidly collapsed . Gothic identity survived , however , especially in Marca Hispanica and the Kingdom of Asturias , which had been founded by the Visigothic nobleman Pelagius of Asturias after his victory over the Moors at the Battle of Covadonga .   During their governance of the Kingdom of Hispania , the Visigoths built several churches that survive . They also left many artifacts , which have been discovered in increasing numbers by archaeologists in recent times . The Treasure of Guarrazar of votive crowns and crosses is the most spectacular . They founded the only new cities in western Europe from the fall of the Western half of the Roman Empire until the rise of the Carolingian dynasty . Many Visigothic names are still in use in modern Spanish and Portuguese . Their most notable legacy , however , was the Visigothic Code , which served , among other things , as the basis for court procedure in most of Christian Iberia until the Late Middle Ages , centuries after the demise of the kingdom .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

140140,The Washington Monument's height is either 554 ft or 555 ft.,Washington_Monument,"The Washington Monument is an obelisk on the National Mall in Washington , D.C. , built to commemorate George Washington , once commander-in-chief of the Continental Army and the first President of the United States . Located almost due east of the Reflecting Pool and the Lincoln Memorial , the monument , made of marble , granite , and bluestone gneiss , is both the world 's tallest stone structure and the world 's tallest obelisk , standing 554 ft tall according to the National Geodetic Survey ( measured 2013 -- 14 ) or 555 ft tall according to the National Park Service ( measured 1884 ) .  It is the tallest monumental column in the world if all are measured above their pedestrian entrances .   Construction of the monument began in 1848 , and was halted from 1854 to 1877 due to a lack of funds , a struggle for control over the Washington National Monument Society , and the intervention of the American Civil War . Although the stone structure was completed in 1884 , internal ironwork , the knoll , and other finishing touches were not completed until 1888 . A difference in shading of the marble , visible approximately 150 ft or 27 % up , shows where construction was halted and later resumed with marble from a different source . The original design was by Robert Mills , but he did not include his proposed colonnade due to a lack of funds , proceeding only with a bare obelisk . Despite many proposals to embellish the obelisk , only its original flat top was altered to a pointed marble pyramidion , in 1884 . The cornerstone was laid on July 4 , 1848 ; the first stone was laid atop the unfinished stump on ; the capstone was set on ; the completed monument was dedicated on ; and officially opened . Upon completion , it became the world 's tallest structure , a title previously held by the Cologne Cathedral . The monument held this designation until 1889 , when the Eiffel Tower was completed in Paris , France .   The monument was damaged during the 2011 Virginia earthquake and Hurricane Irene in the same year and remained closed to the public while the structure was assessed and repaired . After 32 months of repairs , the National Park Service and the Trust for the National Mall reopened the Washington Monument to visitors on .   As of September 2016 , the monument has been closed indefinitely due to reliability issues with the current elevator system .   On December 2 , 2016 , the National Park Service announced that the monument would be closed until 2019 in order to modernize the elevator . The $ 2 to 3 million project will correct the elevator 's ongoing mechanical , electrical and computer issues , which have shuttered the monument since August 17 . The National Park Service has also requested funding in its FY 2017 President 's Budget Request to construct a permanent screening facility for the Washington Monument .

A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west , the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest , Norway to the north , and Russia to the east . Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland . Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia , which also includes Scandinavia . Finland 's population is 5.5 million ( 2014 ) , and the majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region . 88.7 % of the population is Finnish people who speak Finnish , a Uralic language unrelated to the Scandinavian languages ; the second major group are the Finland-Swedes ( 5.3 % ) . In terms of area , it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union .   Finland is a parliamentary republic with a central government based in the capital Helsinki , local governments in 311 municipalities , and an autonomous region , the Åland Islands . Over 1.4 million people live in the Greater Helsinki metropolitan area , which produces a third of the country 's GDP . From the late 12th century , Finland was an integral part of Sweden , a legacy reflected in the prevalence of the Swedish language and its official status . In the spirit of the notion of Adolf Ivar Arwidsson ( 1791 -- 1858 ) , `` we are not Swedes , we do not want to become Russians , let us therefore be Finns '' , the Finnish national identity started to become established . Nevertheless , in 1809 , Finland was incorporated into the Russian Empire as the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland . In 1906 , Finland became the second nation in the world to give the right to vote to all adult citizens and the first in the world to give all adult citizens the right to run for public office . Following the 1917 Russian Revolution , Finland declared itself independent .   In 1918 , the fledgling state was divided by civil war , with the Bolshevik-leaning `` Reds '' supported by the equally new Soviet Russia , fighting the `` Whites '' , supported by the German Empire . After a brief attempt to establish a kingdom , the country became a republic . During World War II , the Soviet Union sought repeatedly to occupy Finland , with Finland losing parts of Karelia , Salla and Kuusamo , Petsamo and some islands , but retaining independence . Finland joined the United Nations in 1955 and established an official policy of neutrality . The Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948 gave the Soviet Union some leverage in Finnish domestic politics during the Cold War era . Finland joined the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) in 1969 , the NATO Partnership for Peace on 1994 , the European Union in 1995 , the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council in 1997 , and finally the Eurozone at its inception , in 1999 .   Finland was a relative latecomer to industrialization , remaining a largely agrarian country until the 1950s . It rapidly developed an advanced economy while building an extensive Nordic-style welfare state , resulting in widespread prosperity and one of the highest per capita incomes in the world . However , Finnish GDP growth has been negative in 2012 -- 2014 ( − 0.698 % to − 1.426 % ) , with a preceding nadir of − 8 % in 2009 .

He was the leader of Free France ( 1940 -- 44 ) and the head of the Provisional Government of the French Republic ( 1944 -- 46 ) . In 1958 , he founded the Fifth Republic and was elected as the President of France , a position he held until his resignation in 1969 . He was the dominant figure of France during the Cold War era and his memory continues to influence French politics .   Born in Lille , he graduated from Saint-Cyr in 1912 . He was a decorated officer of the First World War , wounded several times , and later taken prisoner at Verdun . During the interwar period , he advocated mobile armoured divisions . During the German invasion of May 1940 , he led an armoured division which counterattacked the invaders ; he was then appointed Under-Secretary for War . Refusing to accept his government 's armistice with Nazi Germany , de Gaulle exhorted the French population to resist occupation and to continue the fight in his Appeal of 18 June . He led a government in exile and the Free French Forces against the Axis . Despite frosty relations with Britain and especially the United States , he emerged as the undisputed leader of the French resistance . He became Head of the Provisional Government of the French Republic in June 1944 , the interim government of France following its Liberation . As early as 1944 , de Gaulle introduced a dirigiste economic policy , which included substantial state-directed control over a capitalist economy which was followed by thirty years of unprecedented growth .   Frustrated by the return of petty partisanship in the new Fourth Republic , he resigned in early 1946 but continued to be politically active as founder of the RPF party . He retired in the early 1950s and wrote his War Memoirs , which quickly became a classic of modern French literature . When the Algerian War was ripping apart the unstable Fourth Republic , the National Assembly brought him back to power during the May 1958 crisis . De Gaulle founded the Fifth Republic with a strong presidency , and he was elected in that role . He managed to keep France together while taking steps to end the war , much to the anger of the Pieds-Noirs ( Frenchmen settled in Algeria ) and the military ; both previously had supported his return to power to maintain colonial rule . He granted independence to Algeria and progressively to other French colonies .   In the context of the Cold War , de Gaulle initiated his `` Politics of Grandeur '' , asserting that France as a major power should not rely on other countries , such as the US , for its national security and prosperity . To this end , de Gaulle pursued a policy of `` national independence '' which led him to withdraw from NATO 's military integrated command and to launch an independent nuclear development program that made France the fourth nuclear power . He restored cordial Franco-German relations to create a European counterweight between the Anglo-American and Soviet spheres of influence . However , he opposed any development of a supranational Europe , favouring a Europe of sovereign nations . De Gaulle openly criticised the US intervention in Vietnam and the `` exorbitant privilege '' of the US dollar . In his later years , his support for an independent Quebec and his two vetoes against Britain 's entry into the European Community generated considerable controversy .   Although re-elected President in 1965 , in May 1968 he appeared likely to lose power amid widespread protests by students and workers but survived the crisis with backing from the Army and won an election with an increased majority in the Assembly . De Gaulle resigned in 1969 after losing a referendum in which he proposed more decentralization . He died a year later at his residence in Colombey-les-Deux-Églises , leaving his Presidential memoirs unfinished . Many French political parties and figures claim the Gaullist legacy .   De Gaulle was ranked as `` Le Plus Grand Français de tous les temps '' ( the Greatest Frenchman of All Time ) .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Until 1971 , the postmaster general was the head of the Post Office Department ( or simply `` Post Office '' until the 1820s ) . From 1829 to 1971 , he was a member of the President 's Cabinet .   The Cabinet post of Postmaster General was often given to a new President 's campaign manager or other key political supporter , and was considered something of a sinecure . The Postmaster General was in charge of the governing party 's patronage , and was a powerful position which held much influence within the party .   In 1971 , the Post Office Department was re-organized into the United States Postal Service , an independent agency of the executive branch .

19484,The Vandals established kingdoms in the 8th century.,Vandals,"The Vandals were an East Germanic tribe , or group of tribes , who were first heard of in southern Poland , but later moved around Europe establishing kingdoms in Spain and later North Africa in the 5th century .   The Vandals are believed to have migrated from southern Scandinavia to the area between the lower Oder and Vistula rivers during the 2nd century BC and to have settled in Silesia from around 120 BC . They are associated with the Przeworsk culture and were possibly the same people as the Lugii . Expanding into Dacia during the Marcomannic Wars and to Pannonia during the Crisis of the Third Century , the Vandals were confined to Pannonia by the Goths around 330 AD , where they received permission to settle by Constantine the Great . Around 400 , raids by the Huns forced many of the Germanic tribes like the Goths to migrate to the Roman Empire , and fearing that they might be targeted next , the Vandals were pushed westwards crossing the Rhine into Gaul along with other tribes in 406 . In 409 , the Vandals crossed the Pyrenees into the Iberian Peninsula , where their main groups , the Hasdingi and the Silingi , settled in Gallaecia ( northwest ) and Baetica ( south central ) respectively .   After the Visigoths invaded Iberia , the Iranian Alans and Silingi Vandals voluntarily subjected to the rule of Hasdingian leader Gunderic , who was pushed from Gallaecia to Baetica by a Roman-Suebi coalition in 419 . In 429 , under king Genseric , the Vandals entered North Africa . By 439 they established a kingdom which included the Roman province of Africa as well as Sicily , Corsica , Sardinia , Malta and the Balearic Islands . They fended off several Roman attempts to recapture the African province , and sacked the city of Rome in 455 . Their kingdom collapsed in the Vandalic War of 533 -- 4 , in which Justinian I managed to reconquer the province for the Eastern Roman Empire .   Renaissance and Early Modern writers characterized the Vandals as barbarians , `` sacking and looting '' Rome . This led to the use of the term `` vandalism '' to describe any senseless destruction , particularly the `` barbarian '' defacing of artwork . However , modern historians tend to regard the Vandals during the transitional period from Late Antiquity to the Early Middle Ages as perpetuators , not destroyers , of Roman culture .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

United Airlines first placed the 767 in commercial service in 1982 . The aircraft was initially flown on domestic and transcontinental routes , during which it demonstrated the reliability of its twinjet design . In 1985 , the 767 became the first twin-engined airliner to receive regulatory approval for extended overseas flights . The aircraft was then used to expand non-stop service on medium - to long-haul intercontinental routes . In 1986 , Boeing initiated studies for a higher-capacity 767 , ultimately leading to the development of the 777 , a larger wide-body twinjet . In the 1990s , the 767 became the most frequently used airliner for transatlantic flights between North America and Europe .   The 767 is the first twinjet wide-body type to reach 1,000 aircraft delivered . As of April 2017 , Boeing has received 1,204 orders for the 767 from 74 customers ; 1,098 have been delivered .

219190,Species distribution can be understood through many factors except continental drift.,Species_distribution,"Species distribution is the manner in which a biological taxon is spatially arranged . Species distribution is not to be confused with dispersal , which is the movement of individuals away from their area of origin or from centers of high on density . A similar concept is the species range . A species range is often represented with a species range map . Biogeographers try to understand the factors determining a species ' distribution . The pattern of distribution is not permanent for each species . Distribution patterns can change seasonally , in response to the availability of resources , and also depending on the scale at which they are viewed . Dispersion usually takes place at the time of reproduction . Populations within a species are translocated through many methods , including dispersal by people , wind , water and animals . Humans are one of the largest distributors due to the current trends in globalization and the expanse of the transportation industry . For example , large tankers often fill their ballasts with water at one port and empty them in another , causing a wider distribution of aquatic species .   Biogeography is the study of the distribution of biodiversity over space and time . It is very useful in understanding species distribution through factors such as speciation , extinction , continental drift , glaciation , variation of sea levels , river capture and available resources . This branch of study not only gives a description of the species distribution , but also a geographical explanation for the distribution of particular species . The traditional biogeographic regions were first modeled by Alfred Wallace in The Geographical Distribution of Animals ( 1876 ) . These were based on the work of Sclater 's terrestrial biogeographic regions . Wallace 's system was based on both birds and vertebrates , including non-flying mammals , which better reflect the natural divisions of the Earth due to their limited dispersal abilities .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

With an area of approximately 44 hectares ( 110 acres ) , and a population of 1,000 , it is the smallest state in the world by both area and population . However , formally it is not sovereign , with sovereignty being held by the Holy See , the only entity of public international law that has diplomatic relations with almost every country in the world .   It is an ecclesiastical or sacerdotal-monarchical state ( a type of theocracy ) ruled by the Bishop of Rome -- the Pope . The highest state functionaries are all Catholic clergy of various national origins . Since the return of the Popes from Avignon in 1377 , they have generally resided at the Apostolic Palace within what is now Vatican City , although at times residing instead in the Quirinal Palace in Rome or elsewhere .   Vatican City is distinct from the Holy See ( -LSB- Sancta Sedes , links = no -RSB- ) , which dates back to early Christianity and is the main episcopal see of 1.2 billion Latin and Eastern Catholic adherents around the globe . The independent city-state , on the other hand , came into existence in 1929 by the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and Italy , which spoke of it as a new creation , not as a vestige of the much larger Papal States ( 756 -- 1870 ) , which had previously encompassed much of central Italy . According to the terms of the treaty , the Holy See has `` full ownership , exclusive dominion , and sovereign authority and jurisdiction '' over the city-state .   Within Vatican City are religious and cultural sites such as St. Peter 's Basilica , the Sistine Chapel and the Vatican Museums .

194745,L. Ron Hubbard died in September 1986.,L._Ron_Hubbard,"Lafayette Ronald Hubbard ( March 13 , 1911 -- January 24 , 1986 ) , better known as L. Ron Hubbard ( -LSB- ɛl_rɒn_ˈhʌˌbərd -RSB- ) and often referred to by his initials , LRH , was an American author and the founder of the Church of Scientology . In 2014 , Hubbard was cited by the Smithsonian magazine as one of the 100 most significant Americans of all time , as one of the eleven religious figures on that list . After establishing a career as a writer , becoming best known for his science fiction and fantasy stories , he developed a system called Dianetics which was first expounded in book form in May 1950 . He subsequently developed his ideas into a wide-ranging set of doctrines and practices as part of a new religious movement that he called Scientology . His writings became the guiding texts for the Church of Scientology and a number of affiliated organizations that address such diverse topics as business administration , literacy and drug rehabilitation . The Church 's dissemination of these materials led to Hubbard being listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the most translated and published author in the world . The Guinness World Record for the most audio books published for one author is also held by Hubbard .   Although many aspects of Hubbard 's life story are disputed , there is general agreement about its basic outline . Born in Tilden , Nebraska , he spent much of his childhood in Helena , Montana . He traveled in Asia and the South Pacific in the late 1920s after his father , an officer in the United States Navy , was posted to the U.S. naval base on Guam . He attended George Washington University in Washington , D.C. at the start of the 1930s , before dropping out and beginning his career as a prolific writer of pulp fiction stories . He served briefly in the United States Marine Corps Reserve and was an officer in the United States Navy during World War II , briefly commanding two ships , the USS YP-422 and USS PC-815 . He was removed both times when his superiors found him incapable of command . The last few months of his active service were spent in a hospital , being treated for a duodenal ulcer .   After the war , Hubbard developed a philosophy he called Dianetics , which he called `` the modern science of mental health '' . He founded Scientology in 1952 and oversaw the growth of the Church of Scientology into a worldwide organization . During the late 1960s and early 1970s , he spent much of his time at sea on his personal fleet of ships as `` Commodore '' of the Sea Organization , an elite inner group of Scientologists . His expedition came to an end when Britain , Greece , Spain , Portugal , and Venezuela all closed their ports to his fleet . At one point , a court in Australia revoked the Church 's status as a religion , though it was later reinstated . Hubbard returned to the United States in 1975 and went into seclusion in the California desert . In 1978 , a trial court in France convicted Hubbard of fraud in absentia . Others convictions from the same trial were reversed on appeal , but Hubbard died before the court considered his case .   In 1983 L. Ron Hubbard was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in an international information infiltration and theft project called `` Operation Snow White '' . He spent the remaining years of his life on his ranch , the `` Whispering Wind , '' near Creston , California , where he died in 1986 . A small group of Scientology officials and physician Dr. Eugene Denk attended to him before his death , for a number of ailments including chronic pancreatitis . In 1986 , he died at age 74 in a 1982 Blue Bird motor home , which was situated on his property .   The Church of Scientology describes Hubbard in hagiographic terms , and he portrayed himself as a pioneering explorer , world traveler , and nuclear physicist with expertise in a wide range of disciplines , including photography , art , poetry , and philosophy . In Scientology publications , he is referred to as `` Founder '' and `` Source '' of Scientology and Dianetics . His critics , including his own son Ronald DeWolf , have characterized him as a liar , a charlatan , and mentally unstable , though DeWolf later repudiated those statements . Though many of Hubbard 's autobiographical statements have been found to be fictitious , the Church rejects any suggestion that its account of Hubbard 's life is not historical fact .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Starring Neve Campbell , Courteney Cox , and David Arquette , the film series grossed over $ 604 million in worldwide box-office receipts and consists of four motion pictures directed by Craven . The first series entry , Scream , was released on December 20 , 1996 and is currently the highest-grossing slasher film in the United States . The second entry Scream 2 was released on December 12 , 1997 followed by a third installment , Scream 3 , released February 4 , 2000 . Eleven years after the previous film , Scream 4 was released on April 15 , 2011 . The films follow Sidney Prescott , and her war against a succession of murderers who adopt the guise of Ghostface to stalk and torment their victims . Sidney receives support in the films from town deputy Dewey Riley , reporter Gale Weathers , and film-geek Randy Meeks . A tv spin off of the series was released by MTV on June 30 , 2015 . The series follows different characters and new storylines , not connected to the film series .   Williamson 's original script was bought by Miramax and developed under the Dimension Films label by Bob and Harvey Weinstein , who recruited Craven to direct , who in turn recruited composer Marco Beltrami to score the film . This team went on to be involved in each film in the series though Williamson was forced to take a smaller role for Scream 3 , writing only a brief plot outline due to his commitments to other projects , with Ehren Kruger replacing him as screenwriter . The series ' violence resulted in conflicts with the Motion Picture Association of America and news media concerning censorship resulting in a reduction of violence and gore in Scream 3 when the Columbine High School massacre brought increased focus on the media 's influence on society . Scream became notable for its use of established and recognizable actors which was uncommon for horror films at the time , yet has since become common in part due to Scream 's success .   The series , particularly the first two films , has received significant critical acclaim . Scream has been credited with revitalizing the horror genre in the late 90s by combining a traditional slasher film with humor , awareness of horror film cliché and a clever plot . Scream was one of the highest-grossing films of 1996 and became , and remains , the highest grossing slasher film in the world . Its success was matched by Scream 2 which not only broke box-office records of the time , but was also argued by some critics to actually be superior to the original . Scream 3 fared worse than its predecessors , both critically and financially , with critics commenting that it had become the type of horror film it originally parodied in Scream . It did , however , receive some positive response , with claims that it was the perfect end to the trilogy . The film series has been the recipient of several awards including a Saturn Award for Best Actress and MTV Movie Award for Best Female Performance for Campbell and Best Horror Film for Scream .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Franklin was a renowned polymath and a leading author , printer , political theorist , politician , freemason , postmaster , scientist , inventor , civic activist , statesman , and diplomat . As a scientist , he was a major figure in the American Enlightenment and the history of physics for his discoveries and theories regarding electricity . As an inventor , he is known for the lightning rod , bifocals , and the Franklin stove , among other inventions . He facilitated many civic organizations , including Philadelphia 's fire department and the University of Pennsylvania , an Ivy League institution .   Franklin earned the title of `` The First American '' for his early and indefatigable campaigning for colonial unity , initially as an author and spokesman in London for several colonies . As the first United States Ambassador to France , he exemplified the emerging American nation . Franklin was foundational in defining the American ethos as a marriage of the practical values of thrift , hard work , education , community spirit , self-governing institutions , and opposition to authoritarianism both political and religious , with the scientific and tolerant values of the Enlightenment . In the words of historian Henry Steele Commager , `` In a Franklin could be merged the virtues of Puritanism without its defects , the illumination of the Enlightenment without its heat . '' To Walter Isaacson , this makes Franklin `` the most accomplished American of his age and the most influential in inventing the type of society America would become . ''   Franklin became a successful newspaper editor and printer in Philadelphia , the leading city in the colonies , publishing the Pennsylvania Gazette at the age of 23 . He became wealthy publishing this and Poor Richard 's Almanack , which he authored under the pseudonym `` Richard Saunders '' . After 1767 , he was associated with the Pennsylvania Chronicle , a newspaper that was known for its revolutionary sentiments and criticisms of the British policies .   He pioneered and was first president of The Academy and College of Philadelphia which opened in 1751 and later became the University of Pennsylvania . He organized and was the first secretary of the American Philosophical Society and was elected president in 1769 . Franklin became a national hero in America as an agent for several colonies when he spearheaded an effort in London to have the Parliament of Great Britain repeal the unpopular Stamp Act . An accomplished diplomat , he was widely admired among the French as American minister to Paris and was a major figure in the development of positive Franco-American relations . His efforts proved vital for the American Revolution in securing shipments of crucial munitions from France .   He was promoted to deputy postmaster-general for the British colonies in 1753 , having been Philadelphia postmaster for many years , and this enabled him to set up the first national communications network . During the Revolution , he became the first US Postmaster General . He was active in community affairs and colonial and state politics , as well as national and international affairs . From 1785 to 1788 , he served as governor of Pennsylvania . He initially owned and dealt in slaves but , by the 1750s , he argued against slavery from an economic perspective and became one of the most prominent abolitionists .   His colorful life and legacy of scientific and political achievement , and his status as one of America 's most influential Founding Fathers have seen Franklin honored more than two centuries after his death on coinage and the $ 100 bill , warships , and the names of many towns , counties , educational institutions , and corporations , as well as countless cultural references .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Symptoms of a PE may include shortness of breath , chest pain particularly upon breathing in , and coughing up blood . Symptoms of a blood clot in the leg may also be present such as a red , warm , swollen , and painful leg . Signs of a PE include low blood oxygen levels , rapid breathing , rapid heart rate , and sometimes a mild fever . Severe cases can lead to passing out , abnormally low blood pressure , and sudden death .   PE usually results from a blood clot in the leg that travels to the lung . The risk of blood clots is increased by cancer , prolonged bed rest , smoking , stroke , certain genetic conditions , estrogen-based medication , pregnancy , obesity , and after some types of surgery . A small proportion of cases are due to the embolization of air , fat , or amniotic fluid . Diagnosis is based on signs and symptoms in combination with test results . If the risk is low a blood test known as a D-dimer will rule out the condition . Otherwise a CT pulmonary angiography , lung ventilation/perfusion scan , or ultrasound of the legs may confirm the diagnosis . Together deep vein thrombosis and PE are known as venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) .   Efforts to prevent PE include beginning to move as soon as possible after surgery , lower leg exercises during periods of sitting , and the use of blood thinners after some types of surgery . Treatment is typically with blood thinners such as heparin or warfarin . Often these are recommended for six months or longer . Severe cases may require thrombolysis using medication such as tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) , or may require surgery such as a pulmonary thrombectomy . If blood thinners are not appropriate , a vena cava filter may be used .   Pulmonary emboli affect about 430,000 people each year in Europe . In the United States between 300,000 and 600,000 cases occur each year , which results in between 50,000 and 200,000 deaths . Rates are similar in males and females .

35855,Mars is far away from Olympus Mons.,Mars,"Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System , after Mercury . Named after the Roman god of war , it is often referred to as the `` Red Planet '' because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance . Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere , having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys , deserts , and polar ice caps of Earth .   The rotational period and seasonal cycles of Mars are likewise similar to those of Earth , as is the tilt that produces the seasons . Mars is the site of Olympus Mons , the largest volcano and second-highest known mountain in the Solar System , and of Valles Marineris , one of the largest canyons in the Solar System . The smooth Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40 % of the planet and may be a giant impact feature . Mars has two moons , Phobos and Deimos , which are small and irregularly shaped . These may be captured asteroids , similar to 5261 Eureka , a Mars trojan .   There are ongoing investigations assessing the past habitability potential of Mars , as well as the possibility of extant life . Future astrobiology missions are planned , including the Mars 2020 and ExoMars rovers . Liquid water can not exist on the surface of Mars due to low atmospheric pressure , which is about that of the Earth 's , except at the lowest elevations for short periods . The two polar ice caps appear to be made largely of water . The volume of water ice in the south polar ice cap , if melted , would be sufficient to cover the entire planetary surface to a depth of 11 m . In November 2016 , NASA reported finding a large amount of underground ice in the Utopia Planitia region of Mars . The volume of water detected has been estimated to be equivalent to the volume of water in Lake Superior .   Mars can easily be seen from Earth with the naked eye , as can its reddish coloring . Its apparent magnitude reaches − 2.91 , which is surpassed only by Jupiter , Venus , the Moon , and the Sun . Optical ground-based telescopes are typically limited to resolving features about 300 km across when Earth and Mars are closest because of Earth 's atmosphere .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Following the Golden Age of Comic Books and an interregnum in the early to mid-1950s , the Silver Age is considered to cover the period from 1956 to circa 1970 , and was succeeded by the Bronze and Modern Ages .   The popularity and circulation of comic books about superheroes declined following World War II , and comic books about horror , crime and romance took larger shares of the market . However , controversy arose over alleged links between comic books and juvenile delinquency , focusing in particular on crime and horror titles . In 1954 , publishers implemented the Comics Code Authority to regulate comic content .   In the wake of these changes , publishers began introducing superhero stories again , a change that began with the introduction of a new version of DC Comics ' The Flash in Showcase # 4 ( Oct. 1956 ) . In response to strong demand , DC began publishing more superhero titles including Justice League of America , which prompted Marvel Comics to follow suit beginning with Fantastic Four # 1 .   A number of important comics writers and artists contributed to the early part of the era , including writers Stan Lee , Gardner Fox , John Broome , and Robert Kanigher , and artists Curt Swan , Jack Kirby , Gil Kane , Steve Ditko , Mike Sekowsky , Gene Colan , Carmine Infantino , John Buscema , and John Romita , Sr. . By the end of the Silver Age , a new generation of talent had entered the field , including writers Denny O'Neil , Gary Friedrich , Roy Thomas , and Archie Goodwin , and artists such as Neal Adams , Herb Trimpe , Jim Steranko , and Barry Windsor-Smith .

101125,A near-Earth object is not a planet and it is in the universe.,Near-Earth_object,"A near-Earth object ( NEO ) is any small Solar System body whose orbit brings it into proximity with Earth . By definition , a solar system body is a NEO if its closest approach to the Sun ( perihelion ) is less than 1.3 astronomical unit ( AU ) . NEOs include more than fourteen thousand near-Earth asteroids ( NEAs ) , more than one hundred near-Earth comets ( NECs ) , and a number of solar-orbiting spacecraft and meteoroids , large enough to be tracked in space before striking the Earth . It is now widely accepted that collisions in the past have had a significant role in shaping the geological and biological history of the Earth . NEOs have become of increased interest since the 1980s because of increased awareness of the potential danger some of the asteroids or comets pose , and mitigations are being researched . In January 2016 , NASA announced the Planetary Defense Coordination Office to track NEOs larger than 30 to 50 meters in diameter and coordinate an effective threat response and mitigation effort .   NEAs have orbits that lie partly between 0.983 and 1.3 AU away from the Sun . When a NEA is detected it is submitted to the IAU 's Minor Planet Center for cataloging . Some NEAs orbits intersect that of Earth 's so they pose a collision danger . The United States , European Union , and other nations are currently scanning for NEOs in an effort called Spaceguard .   In the United States and since 1998 , NASA has a congressional mandate to catalogue all NEOs that are at least 1 kilometer wide , as the impact of such an object would be globally catastrophic . In 2006 , it was estimated that 20 % of the mandated objects had not yet been found . In 2011 , largely as a result of NEOWISE , it was estimated that 93 % of the NEAs larger than 1 km had been found and that only about 70 remained to be discovered . , there have been 875 NEAs larger than 1 km discovered , of which 157 are potentially hazardous . The inventory is much less complete for smaller objects , which still have potential for large scale , though not global , damage .   Potentially hazardous objects ( PHOs ) are currently defined based on parameters that measure the object 's potential to make threatening close approaches to the Earth . Mostly objects with an Earth minimum orbit intersection distance ( MOID ) of 0.05 AU or less and an absolute magnitude ( H ) of 22.0 or brighter ( a rough indicator of large size ) are considered PHOs . Objects that can not approach closer to the Earth ( i.e. MOID ) than 0.05 AU , or are smaller than about 150 m ( 500 ft ) in diameter ( i.e. H = 22.0 with assumed albedo of 13 % ) , are not considered PHOs . NASA 's catalog for near-Earth objects also includes the approach distances of asteroids and comets measured in lunar distances , and this usage has become a common unit of measure used by the news media in discussing these objects .   Some NEOs are of special interest because they can be physically explored with lower mission velocity than for even the Moon , due to their combination of low velocity with respect to Earth ( ΔV ) and weak gravity , so they may present interesting scientific opportunities both for direct geochemical and astronomical investigation , and as potentially economical sources of extraterrestrial materials for human exploitation . This makes them an attractive target for exploration . As of 2016 , three near-Earth objects have been visited by spacecraft .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

It is the sixth-most populous country with a population exceeding 201 million people . In terms of area , it is the 33rd-largest country spanning 881,913 km2 . Pakistan has a 1,046 km coastline along the Arabian Sea and its Gulf of Oman in the south and is bordered by India to the east , Afghanistan to the west , Iran to the southwest , and China in the far northeast , respectively . It is separated from Tajikistan by Afghanistan 's narrow Wakhan Corridor in the north , and also shares a maritime border with Oman .   The territory that now constitutes Pakistan is considered a cradle of civilisation that was previously home to several ancient cultures , including the Mehrgarh of the Neolithic and the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilisation , and later home to kingdoms ruled by people of different faiths and cultures , including Hindus , Indo-Greeks , Muslims , Turco-Mongols , Afghans , and Sikhs . The area has been ruled by numerous empires and dynasties , including the Persian Achaemenid Empire , Alexander of Macedonia , the Indian Mauryan Empire , the Arab Umayyad Caliphate , the Delhi Sultanate , the Mongol Empire , the Mughal Empire , the Durrani Empire , the Sikh Empire , and most recently , the British Empire .   Pakistan is unique among Muslim countries in that it is the only country to have been created in the name of Islam . As a result of the Pakistan Movement led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah and the subcontinent 's struggle for independence , Pakistan was created in 1947 as an independent homeland for South Asian Muslims . It is an ethnically and linguistically diverse country , with a similarly diverse geography and wildlife . Initially a dominion , Pakistan adopted a constitution in 1956 , becoming an Islamic republic . An ethnic civil war in 1971 resulted in the secession of East Pakistan as the new country of Bangladesh . In 1973 Pakistan adopted a new constitution establishing , alongside its pre-existing parliamentary republic status , a federal government based in Islamabad consisting of four provinces and four federal territories . The new constitution also stipulated that all laws were to conform to the injunctions of Islam as laid down in the Quran and Sunnah .   A regional and middle power , Pakistan has the sixth-largest standing armed forces in the world and is also a nuclear power as well as a declared nuclear-weapons state , being the second in South Asia and the only nation in the Muslim world to have that status . Pakistan has a semi-industrialised economy with a well-integrated agriculture sector , and a growing services sector . The Pakistani economy is the 24th-largest in the world in terms of purchasing power and the 41st-largest in terms of nominal GDP ( World Bank ) . It is ranked among the emerging and growth-leading economies of the world , and is backed by one of the world 's largest and fastest-growing middle classes .   The post-independence history of Pakistan has been characterised by periods of military rule , and since 2008 a transition to democracy , amid conflicts with neighbouring India . The country continues to face challenging problems such as illiteracy , healthcare , and corruption , but has substantially reduced poverty and terrorism and expanded per capita income . Pakistan is a member of the United Nations , the Non-Aligned Movement , the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation , the Commonwealth of Nations , the ECO , the SAARC , the Developing Eight , and the G20 developing nations , Group of 24 , Group of 77 , and ECOSOC .

Haute couture is high end fashion that is constructed by hand from start to finish , made from high quality , expensive , often unusual fabric and sewn with extreme attention to detail and finished by the most experienced and capable sewers , often using time-consuming , hand-executed techniques . Couture translates literally from French as `` dressmaking '' but may also refer to fashion , sewing , or needlework - Fashion-Era and is also used as a common abbreviation of haute couture and refers to the same thing in spirit . Haute translates literally to `` high '' . A haute couture garment is often made for a client , tailored specifically for the wearer 's measurements and body stance . Considering the amount of time , money , and skill allotted to each completed piece , haute couture garments are also described as having no price tag : budget is not relevant .   The term originally referred to Englishman Charles Frederick Worth 's work , produced in Paris in the mid-nineteenth century . In modern France , haute couture is a protected name that may not be used except by firms that meet certain well-defined standards . However , the term is also used loosely to describe all high-fashion custom-fitted clothing whether it is produced in Paris or in other fashion capitals such as London , Milan , New York City or Tokyo .

43641,Charles de Gaulle lost all elections for President of the Fifth French Republic.,Charles_de_Gaulle,"Charles André Joseph Marie de Gaulle ( -LSB- ʃaʁl də ɡol -RSB- ; 22 November 1890 -- 9 November 1970 ) was a French general and statesman . He was the leader of Free France ( 1940 -- 44 ) and the head of the Provisional Government of the French Republic ( 1944 -- 46 ) . In 1958 , he founded the Fifth Republic and was elected as the President of France , a position he held until his resignation in 1969 . He was the dominant figure of France during the Cold War era and his memory continues to influence French politics .   Born in Lille , he graduated from Saint-Cyr in 1912 . He was a decorated officer of the First World War , wounded several times , and later taken prisoner at Verdun . During the interwar period , he advocated mobile armoured divisions . During the German invasion of May 1940 , he led an armoured division which counterattacked the invaders ; he was then appointed Under-Secretary for War . Refusing to accept his government 's armistice with Nazi Germany , de Gaulle exhorted the French population to resist occupation and to continue the fight in his Appeal of 18 June . He led a government in exile and the Free French Forces against the Axis . Despite frosty relations with Britain and especially the United States , he emerged as the undisputed leader of the French resistance . He became Head of the Provisional Government of the French Republic in June 1944 , the interim government of France following its Liberation . As early as 1944 , de Gaulle introduced a dirigiste economic policy , which included substantial state-directed control over a capitalist economy which was followed by thirty years of unprecedented growth .   Frustrated by the return of petty partisanship in the new Fourth Republic , he resigned in early 1946 but continued to be politically active as founder of the RPF party . He retired in the early 1950s and wrote his War Memoirs , which quickly became a classic of modern French literature . When the Algerian War was ripping apart the unstable Fourth Republic , the National Assembly brought him back to power during the May 1958 crisis . De Gaulle founded the Fifth Republic with a strong presidency , and he was elected in that role . He managed to keep France together while taking steps to end the war , much to the anger of the Pieds-Noirs ( Frenchmen settled in Algeria ) and the military ; both previously had supported his return to power to maintain colonial rule . He granted independence to Algeria and progressively to other French colonies .   In the context of the Cold War , de Gaulle initiated his `` Politics of Grandeur '' , asserting that France as a major power should not rely on other countries , such as the US , for its national security and prosperity . To this end , de Gaulle pursued a policy of `` national independence '' which led him to withdraw from NATO 's military integrated command and to launch an independent nuclear development program that made France the fourth nuclear power . He restored cordial Franco-German relations to create a European counterweight between the Anglo-American and Soviet spheres of influence . However , he opposed any development of a supranational Europe , favouring a Europe of sovereign nations . De Gaulle openly criticised the US intervention in Vietnam and the `` exorbitant privilege '' of the US dollar . In his later years , his support for an independent Quebec and his two vetoes against Britain 's entry into the European Community generated considerable controversy .   Although re-elected President in 1965 , in May 1968 he appeared likely to lose power amid widespread protests by students and workers but survived the crisis with backing from the Army and won an election with an increased majority in the Assembly . De Gaulle resigned in 1969 after losing a referendum in which he proposed more decentralization . He died a year later at his residence in Colombey-les-Deux-Églises , leaving his Presidential memoirs unfinished . Many French political parties and figures claim the Gaullist legacy .   De Gaulle was ranked as `` Le Plus Grand Français de tous les temps '' ( the Greatest Frenchman of All Time ) .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ
11146,Benzodiazepine is a type of medicine.,Benzodiazepine,"Benzodiazepines ( BZD , BZs ) , sometimes called `` benzos '' , are a class of psychoactive drugs whose core chemical structure is the fusion of a benzene ring and a diazepine ring . The first such drug , chlordiazepoxide ( Librium ) , was discovered accidentally by Leo Sternbach in 1955 , and made available in 1960 by Hoffmann -- La Roche , which , since 1963 , has also marketed the benzodiazepine diazepam ( Valium ) . In 1977 benzodiazepines were globally the most prescribed medications .   Benzodiazepines enhance the effect of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) at the GABAA receptor , resulting in sedative , hypnotic ( sleep-inducing ) , anxiolytic ( anti-anxiety ) , anticonvulsant , and muscle relaxant properties . High doses of many shorter-acting benzodiazepines may also cause anterograde amnesia and dissociation . These properties make benzodiazepines useful in treating anxiety , insomnia , agitation , seizures , muscle spasms , alcohol withdrawal and as a premedication for medical or dental procedures . Benzodiazepines are categorized as either short - , intermediate - , or long-acting . Short - and intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred for the treatment of insomnia ; longer-acting benzodiazepines are recommended for the treatment of anxiety .   Benzodiazepines are generally viewed as safe and effective for short-term use , although cognitive impairment and paradoxical effects such as aggression or behavioral disinhibition occasionally occur . A minority of people can have paradoxical reactions such as worsened agitation or panic . Long-term use is controversial because of concerns about adverse psychological and physical effects , decreasing effectiveness , and physical dependence and withdrawal . As a result of adverse effects associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines , withdrawal from benzodiazepines , in general , leads to improved physical and mental health . The elderly are at an increased risk of suffering from both short - and long-term adverse effects , and as a result , all benzodiazepines are listed in the Beers List of inappropriate medications for older adults .   There is controversy concerning the safety of benzodiazepines in pregnancy . While they are not major teratogens , uncertainty remains as to whether they cause cleft palate in a small number of babies and whether neurobehavioural effects occur as a result of prenatal exposure ; they are known to cause withdrawal symptoms in the newborn . Benzodiazepines can be taken in overdoses and can cause dangerous deep unconsciousness . However , they are less toxic than their predecessors , the barbiturates , and death rarely results when a benzodiazepine is the only drug taken . When combined with other central nervous system ( CNS ) depressants such as alcoholic drinks and opioids , the potential for toxicity and fatal overdose increases . Benzodiazepines are commonly misused and taken in combination with other drugs of abuse .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Located almost due east of the Reflecting Pool and the Lincoln Memorial , the monument , made of marble , granite , and bluestone gneiss , is both the world 's tallest stone structure and the world 's tallest obelisk , standing 554 ft tall according to the National Geodetic Survey ( measured 2013 -- 14 ) or 555 ft tall according to the National Park Service ( measured 1884 ) .  It is the tallest monumental column in the world if all are measured above their pedestrian entrances .   Construction of the monument began in 1848 , and was halted from 1854 to 1877 due to a lack of funds , a struggle for control over the Washington National Monument Society , and the intervention of the American Civil War . Although the stone structure was completed in 1884 , internal ironwork , the knoll , and other finishing touches were not completed until 1888 . A difference in shading of the marble , visible approximately 150 ft or 27 % up , shows where construction was halted and later resumed with marble from a different source . The original design was by Robert Mills , but he did not include his proposed colonnade due to a lack of funds , proceeding only with a bare obelisk . Despite many proposals to embellish the obelisk , only its original flat top was altered to a pointed marble pyramidion , in 1884 . The cornerstone was laid on July 4 , 1848 ; the first stone was laid atop the unfinished stump on ; the capstone was set on ; the completed monument was dedicated on ; and officially opened . Upon completion , it became the world 's tallest structure , a title previously held by the Cologne Cathedral . The monument held this designation until 1889 , when the Eiffel Tower was completed in Paris , France .   The monument was damaged during the 2011 Virginia earthquake and Hurricane Irene in the same year and remained closed to the public while the structure was assessed and repaired .

As of September 2016 , the monument has been closed indefinitely due to reliability issues with the current elevator system .

He was born in the small town of Saint-Gervais-les-Trois-Clochers in the district of Châtellerault , near the city of Loudun . He could be retrospectively classified as a neurologist , but the field did not exist in his time .   During 1873 Tourette began medical studies at Poitiers . He later relocated to Paris where he became a student , amanuensis , and house physician of his mentor , the influential contemporary neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot , director of the Salpêtrière Hospital . Charcot also helped him to advance in his academic career . Tourette studied and lectured in psychotherapy , hysteria and medical and legal ramifications of mesmerism ( modern-day hypnosis ) .   Tourette described the symptoms of Tourette 's syndrome in nine patients in 1884 , using the name `` maladie des tics '' . Charcot renamed the syndrome `` Gilles de la Tourette 's illness '' in his honor .   In 1893 , a former female patient shot Tourette in the head , claiming he had hypnotized her against her will . Both Tourette and many modern hypnologists state that this is impossible . His mentor , Charcot , had died recently , and his young son had also died recently . After these events , Tourette began to experience mood swings between depression and hypomania . Nevertheless , he organized public lectures in which he spoke about literacy , mesmerism and theatre .   Tourette published an article on hysteria in the German Army , which angered Bismarck , and a further article about unhygienic conditions in the floating hospitals on the river Thames . With Gabriel Legué he analyzed abbess Jeanne des Anges ' account of her hysteria that was allegedly based on her unrequited love for a priest Urbain Grandier , who was later burned for witchcraft .   Around 1902 , Tourette 's condition worsened and he was dismissed from his post . Gilles de la Tourette died on 26 May 1904 in a psychiatric hospital in Lausanne , Switzerland .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Founded in 1934 , the company is best known for a series of Gothic `` Hammer Horror '' films made from the mid-1950s until the 1970s . Hammer also produced science fiction , thrillers , film noir and comedies -- and , in later years , television series . During its most successful years , Hammer dominated the horror film market , enjoying worldwide distribution and considerable financial success . This success was due , in part , to distribution partnerships with major United States studios , such as Warner Bros. .   During the late 1960s and 1970s the saturation of the horror film market by competitors and the loss of American funding forced changes to the previously lucrative Hammer formula , with varying degrees of success . The company eventually ceased production in the mid-1980s .

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu was formed from Kodokan judo ground fighting ( newaza ) fundamentals that were taught by a number of individuals including Takeo Yano , Mitsuyo Maeda and Soshihiro Satake . Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu eventually came to be its own art through the experiments , practices , and adaptation of judo through Carlos and Helio Gracie ( who passed their knowledge on to their extended family ) as well as other instructors who were students of Maeda , such as Luiz Franca .   BJJ promotes the concept that a smaller , weaker person can successfully defend against a bigger , stronger , heavier assailant by using proper technique , leverage , and most notably , taking the fight to the ground , and then applying joint-locks and chokeholds to defeat the opponent . BJJ training can be used for sport grappling tournaments and in self-defense situations . Sparring ( commonly referred to as rolling ) and live drilling play a major role in training , and a premium is placed on performance , especially in competition , in relation to progress and ascension through its ranking system .   Since its inception in 1882 , its parent art of judo was separated from older systems of Japanese jujutsu by an important difference that was passed on to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu : it is not solely a martial art , but it is also a sport ; a method for promoting physical fitness and building character in young people ; and , ultimately , a way ( Do ) of life .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

He was a direct descendant of Turco-Mongol conqueror Timur ( Tamurlane ) from the Barlas clan , through his father , and also a descendant of Genghis Khan through his mother . He was also influenced by the Persian culture and this affected both his own actions and those of his successors , giving rise to a significant expansion of the Persianate ethos in the Indian subcontinent .   Babur was the eldest son of Umar Sheikh Mirza . He ascended the throne of Fergana in 1495 at the age of twelve and faced rebellion from his own relatives . He conquered Samarkand two years later , only to lose the city of Fergana soon after . In his attempt to reconquer Fergana , he lost control of Samarkand . In 1501 , his attempt to recapture both cities went in vain as he was defeated by Muhammad Shaybani Khan . In 1504 , he conquered Kabul , which was under the rule of the infant heir of Ulugh Begh . Babur formed a partnership with Safavid ruler Ismail I and reconquered parts of central Asia , including Samarkand , only to again lose it and the other newly conquered lands to the Uzbeks .   After losing Samarkand for the third time , Babur turned his attention to creating his empire in north India . At that time , the Indo-Gangetic Plain of the northern Indian Subcontinent was ruled by Ibrahim Lodi of the Afghan Lodi dynasty , whereas Rajputana was ruled by a Hindu Rajput Confederacy , led by Rana Sanga of Mewar . In 1524 , Daulat Khan Lodi , a rebel of the Lodhi dynasty , invited Babur to overthrow Ibrahim and become ruler . Babur defeated Ibrahim Lodi at the First Battle of Panipat in 1526 and founded the Mughal empire . However , he again faced opposition , this time from Rana Sanga of Mewar who considered Babur a foreigner . The Rana was defeated at the Battle of Khanwa .   Babur married several times . Notable among his sons are Humayun , Kamran Mirza and Hindal Mirza . Babur died in 1530 and was succeeded by Humayun . According to Babur 's wishes , he was buried in Bagh-e-Babur in Kabul , Afghanistan . Being a patrilineal descendant of Timur , Babur considered himself a Timurid and Turk , though Uzbek sources claim him as an ethnic Uzbek . He is considered a national hero in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan . Many of his poems also have become popular folk songs . He wrote his autobiography , Baburnama , in Chaghatai Turkic and this was translated into Persian during Akbar 's reign .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with its neighbor Chile to the west , the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north , Brazil to the northeast , Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east , and the Drake Passage to the south . With a mainland area of 2780400 km2 , Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world , the second largest in Latin America , and the largest Spanish-speaking one . The country is subdivided into twenty-three provinces ( provincias , singular provincia ) and one autonomous city ( ciudad autónoma ) , Buenos Aires , which is the federal capital of the nation ( -LSB- Capital Federal , links = no -RSB- ) as decided by Congress .  The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions , but exist under a federal system .   Argentina claims sovereignty over part of Antarctica , the Falkland Islands ( -LSB- Islas Malvinas , links = no -RSB- ) , and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands . The earliest recorded human presence in the area of modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period . The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century . Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata , a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776 . The declaration and fight for independence ( 1810 -- 1818 ) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861 , culminating in the country 's reorganization as a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city . The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability , with massive waves of European immigration radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook . The almost-unparalleled increase in prosperity led to Argentina becoming the seventh wealthiest developed nation in the world by the early 20th century .   After 1930 , Argentina descended into political instability and periodic economic crises that pushed it back into underdevelopment , though it nevertheless remained among the fifteen richest countries until the mid-20th century . Argentina retains its historic status as a middle power in international affairs , and is a prominent regional power in the Southern Cone and Latin America . Argentina has the second largest economy in South America , the third-largest in Latin America and is a member of the G-15 and G-20 major economies .

The story follows characters Ben ( Jones ) , Barbra ( O'Dea ) , and five others trapped in a rural farmhouse in Western Pennsylvania , which is attacked by a large and growing group of unnamed `` living dead '' monsters drawing on earlier depictions in popular culture of the ghoul , which has led this type of creature to be referred to most popularly as a zombie . This is the most easily recognized version of the living dead , to the point where people gather in mass quantities for conventions dressed as zombies , complete with makeup and prosthetic limbs .

136045,Birmingham is in Suffolk County.,Birmingham,"Birmingham ( -LSB- ˈbɜːmɪŋəm -RSB- ) is a city and metropolitan borough in the West Midlands , England . It is the largest and most populous British city outside London , with a population of 1,101,360 in 2014 .   A medium-sized market town in the medieval period , Birmingham grew to international prominence in the 18th century at the heart of the Midlands Enlightenment and subsequent Industrial Revolution , which saw the town at the forefront of worldwide advances in science , technology , and economic development , producing a series of innovations that laid many of the foundations of modern industrial society . By 1791 it was being hailed as `` the first manufacturing town in the world '' . Birmingham 's distinctive economic profile , with thousands of small workshops practising a wide variety of specialised and highly skilled trades , encouraged exceptional levels of creativity and innovation and provided a diverse and resilient economic base for industrial prosperity that was to last into the final quarter of the 20th century . Perhaps the most important invention in British history , the industrial steam engine , was invented in Birmingham . Its resulting high level of social mobility also fostered a culture of broad-based political radicalism , that under leaders from Thomas Attwood to Joseph Chamberlain was to give it a political influence unparalleled in Britain outside London , and a pivotal role in the development of British democracy . From the summer of 1940 to the spring of 1943 , Birmingham was bombed heavily by the German Luftwaffe in what is known as the Birmingham Blitz . The damage done to the city 's infrastructure , in addition to a deliberate policy of demolition and new building by planners , led to extensive demolition and redevelopment in subsequent decades .   Today Birmingham 's economy is dominated by the service sector . The city is a major international commercial centre , ranked as a gamma + world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ; and an important transport , retail , events and conference hub . Its metropolitan economy is the second largest in the United Kingdom with a GDP of $ 121.1 bn ( 2014 ) , and its six universities make it the largest centre of higher education in the country outside London . Birmingham 's major cultural institutions -- including the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra , the Birmingham Royal Ballet , the Birmingham Repertory Theatre , the Library of Birmingham and the Barber Institute of Fine Arts -- enjoy international reputations , and the city has vibrant and influential grassroots art , music , literary and culinary scenes . Birmingham is the fourth-most visited city in the UK by foreign visitors .   Birmingham 's sporting heritage can be felt worldwide , with the concept of the Football League and lawn tennis both originating from the city . Its most successful football club Aston Villa has won seven league titles and one European Cup with the other professional club being Birmingham City .   People from Birmingham are called Brummies , a term derived from the city 's nickname of Brum . This originates from the city 's dialect name , Brummagem , which may in turn have been derived from one of the city 's earlier names , Bromwicham . There is a distinctive Brummie accent and dialect .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Pocahontas was the daughter of Powhatan , the paramount chief of a network of tributary tribal nations in the Tsenacommacah , encompassing the Tidewater region of Virginia . In a well-known historical anecdote , she is said to have saved the life of a captive of the Native Americans , the Englishman John Smith , in 1607 by placing her head upon his own when her father raised his war club to execute him . Some historians have suggested that this story , as told by Smith , is untrue .   Pocahontas was captured by the English during Anglo-Indian hostilities in 1613 , and held for ransom . During her captivity , she converted to Christianity and took the name Rebecca . When the opportunity arose for her to return to her people , she chose to remain with the English . In April 1614 , she married tobacco planter John Rolfe , and in January 1615 , bore their son , Thomas Rolfe .   In 1616 , the Rolfes traveled to London . Pocahontas was presented to English society as an example of the `` civilized savage '' in hopes of stimulating investment in the Jamestown settlement . She became something of a celebrity , was elegantly fêted , and attended a masque at Whitehall Palace . In 1617 , the Rolfes set sail for Virginia , but Pocahontas died at Gravesend of unknown causes . She was buried in a church in Gravesend in the United Kingdom , but the exact location of her grave is unknown .   Numerous places , landmarks , and products in the United States have been named after Pocahontas . Her story has been romanticized over the years , and she is a subject of art , literature , and film .

20603,"Yemen does not have an area of 203,850 square miles.",Yemen,"Yemen ( -LSB- ˈjɛmən -RSB- اليَمَن ) , officially known as the Republic of Yemen , is an Arab country in Western Asia , occupying South Arabia , the southern end of the Arabian Peninsula . Yemen is the second-largest country in the peninsula , occupying 527,970 km2 ( 203,850 sq mi ) . The coastline stretches for about 2,000 km ( 1,200 mi ) . It is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the north , the Red Sea to the west , the Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea to the south , and Oman to the east-northeast . Although Yemen 's constitutionally stated capital is the city of Sana'a , the city has been under rebel control since February 2015 . Because of this , Yemen 's capital has been temporarily relocated to the port city of Aden , on the southern coast . Yemen 's territory includes more than 200 islands ; the largest of these is Socotra .   Yemen was the home of the Sabaeans ( biblical Sheba ) , a trading state that flourished for over a thousand years and also included parts of modern-day Ethiopia and Eritrea . In 275 AD , the region came under the rule of the later Jewish-influenced Himyarite Kingdom . Christianity arrived in the fourth century , whereas Judaism and local paganism were already established . Islam spread quickly in the seventh century and Yemenite troops were crucial in the expansion of the early Islamic conquests . Administration of Yemen has long been notoriously difficult . Several dynasties emerged from the ninth to 16th centuries , the Rasulid dynasty being the strongest and most prosperous . The country was divided between the Ottoman and British empires in the early twentieth century . The Zaydi Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen was established after World War I in North Yemen before the creation of the Yemen Arab Republic in 1962 . South Yemen remained a British protectorate known as the Aden Protectorate until 1967 when it became an independent state and later , a Marxist state . The two Yemeni states united to form the modern republic of Yemen in 1990 .   Yemen is a developing country , and the poorest country in the Middle East . Under the rule of President Ali Abdullah Saleh , Yemen was described as a kleptocracy . According to the 2009 international corruption Perception Index by Transparency International , Yemen ranked 164 out of 182 countries surveyed . In the absence of strong state institutions , elite politics in Yemen constituted a de facto form of collaborative governance , where competing tribal , regional , religious , and political interests agreed to hold themselves in check through tacit acceptance of the balance it produced . The informal political settlement was held together by a power-sharing deal between three men : president Ali Abdullah Saleh , who controlled the state ; Major General Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar , who controlled the largest share of the Republic of Yemen Armed Forces ; and Abdullah ibn Husayn al-Ahmar , figurehead of the Islamist Islah party and Saudi Arabia 's chosen broker of transnational patronage payments to various political players , including tribal sheikhs . The Saudi payments have been intended to facilitate the tribes ' autonomy from the Yemeni government and to give the Saudi government a mechanism with which to weigh in on Yemen 's political decision-making .   Yemen has been in a state of political crisis since 2011 , starting with street protests against poverty , unemployment , corruption , and president Saleh 's plan to amend Yemen 's constitution and eliminate the presidential term limit , in effect making him president for life . President Saleh stepped down and the powers of the presidency were transferred to Vice President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi , who was formally elected president on 21 February 2012 in a one-man election . The transitional process was disrupted by conflicts between the Houthis and al-Islah , as well as the al-Qaeda insurgency . In September 2014 , the Houthis took over Sana'a , later declaring themselves in control of the government in a coup d'état . Since then , a Saudi-led intervention has taken place , however , it could not stop the civil war . The Saudi-led intervention has caused massive damage to Yemeni infrastructure and has resulted in the bombing of hospitals and funeral processions among other civilian targets .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

116715,There is a spirit named Absinthe.,Absinthe,"Absinthe ( -LSB- ˈæbsɪnθ -RSB- or -LSB- ˈæbsænθ -RSB- French : -LSB- apsɛ̃t -RSB- ) is historically described as a distilled , highly alcoholic ( 45 -- 74 % ABV / 90 -- 148 U.S. proof ) beverage . It is an anise-flavoured spirit derived from botanicals , including the flowers and leaves of Artemisia absinthium ( `` grand wormwood '' ) , together with green anise , sweet fennel , and other medicinal and culinary herbs . Absinthe traditionally has a natural green colour but may also be colourless . It is commonly referred to in historical literature as `` la fée verte '' ( the green fairy ) . Although it is sometimes mistakenly referred to as a liqueur , absinthe is not traditionally bottled with added sugar ; it is therefore classified as a spirit . Absinthe is traditionally bottled at a high level of alcohol by volume , but it is normally diluted with water prior to being consumed .   Absinthe originated in the canton of Neuchâtel in Switzerland in the late 18th century . It rose to great popularity as an alcoholic drink in late 19th - and early 20th-century France , particularly among Parisian artists and writers . Owing in part to its association with bohemian culture , the consumption of absinthe was opposed by social conservatives and prohibitionists . Ernest Hemingway , James Joyce , Charles Baudelaire , Paul Verlaine , Arthur Rimbaud , Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec , Amedeo Modigliani , Pablo Picasso , Vincent van Gogh , Oscar Wilde , Marcel Proust , Aleister Crowley , Erik Satie , Edgar Allan Poe , Lord Byron and Alfred Jarry were all known absinthe drinkers .   Absinthe has often been portrayed as a dangerously addictive psychoactive drug and hallucinogen . The chemical compound thujone , although present in the spirit in only trace amounts , was blamed for its alleged harmful effects . By 1915 , absinthe had been banned in the United States and in much of Europe , including France , the Netherlands , Belgium , Switzerland and Austria-Hungary . Although absinthe was vilified , it has not been demonstrated to be any more dangerous than ordinary spirits . Recent studies have shown that absinthe 's psychoactive properties ( apart from that of the alcohol ) have been exaggerated . A revival of absinthe began in the 1990s , following the adoption of modern European Union food and beverage laws that removed longstanding barriers to its production and sale . By the early 21st century , nearly 200 brands of absinthe were being produced in a dozen countries , most notably in France , Switzerland , Australia , Spain , and the Czech Republic .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

It was delivered by Lincoln during the American Civil War , on the afternoon of Thursday , November 19 , 1863 , at the dedication of the Soldiers ' National Cemetery in Gettysburg , Pennsylvania , four and a half months after the Union armies defeated those of the Confederacy at the Battle of Gettysburg .   Abraham Lincoln 's carefully crafted address , secondary to other presentations that day , was one of the greatest and most influential statements of national purpose . In just over two minutes , Lincoln reiterated the principles of human equality espoused by the Declaration of Independence and proclaimed the Civil War as a struggle for the preservation of the Union sundered by the secession crisis , with `` a new birth of freedom '' that would bring true equality to all of its citizens . Lincoln also redefined the Civil War as a struggle not just for the Union , but also for the principle of human equality .   Beginning with the now-iconic phrase `` Four score and seven years ago '' -- referring to the United States Declaration of Independence in 1776 -- Lincoln examined the founding principles of the United States as stated in the Declaration of Independence . In the context of the Civil War , Lincoln also memorialized the sacrifices of those who gave their lives at Gettysburg and extolled virtues for the listeners ( and the nation ) to ensure the survival of America 's representative democracy : that `` government of the people , by the people , for the people , shall not perish from the earth . ''   Despite the speech 's prominent place in the history and popular culture of the United States , the exact wording and location of the speech are disputed . The five known manuscripts of the Gettysburg Address in Lincoln 's hand differ in a number of details , and also differ from contemporary newspaper reprints of the speech . Modern scholarship locates the speakers ' platform 40 yards ( or more ) away from the Traditional Site within Soldiers ' National Cemetery at the Soldiers ' National Monument and entirely within private , adjacent Evergreen Cemetery .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Monosodium glutamate is found naturally in tomatoes , cheese and other foods .   MSG is used in the food industry as a flavor enhancer with an umami taste that intensifies the meaty , savory flavor of food , as naturally occurring glutamate does in foods such as stews and meat soups .

A popular belief is that large doses of MSG can cause headaches and other feelings of discomfort , known as `` Chinese restaurant syndrome , '' but double-blind tests fail to find evidence of such a reaction .

Long-term use can lead to alcohol abuse , physical dependence , and alcoholism .   Drinking alcohol plays an important social role in many cultures . Most countries have laws regulating their production , sale , and consumption ;  some countries ban such activities entirely . However , alcoholic drinks are legal in most parts of the world . The global alcoholic drink industry exceeded $ 1 trillion in 2014 .   Alcohol is one of the most widely used recreational drugs in the world . For instance , in 2015 , among Americans , 89 % of adults had consumed alcohol at some point , 70 % had drunk it in the last year , and 56 % in the last month . Alcoholic drinks are typically divided into three classes -- beers , wines , and spirits -- and typically contain between 3 % and 40 % alcohol by volume .   Discovery of late Stone Age jugs suggest that intentionally fermented drinks existed at least as early as the Neolithic period ( cir . 10,000 BC ) .

106966,Aphrodite appears in Greek mythology.,Interpretatio_graeca,"Interpretatio graeca ( Latin , `` Greek translation '' or `` interpretation by means of Greek -LSB- models -RSB- '' ) is a discourse in which ancient Greek religious concepts and practices , deities , and myths are used to interpret or attempt to understand the mythology and religion of other cultures . It is thus a comparative methodology that looks for equivalencies and shared characteristics . The phrase may describe Greek efforts to explain others ' beliefs and myths , as when Herodotus describes Egyptian religion in terms of perceived Greek analogues , or when Dionysius of Halicarnassus and Plutarch document Roman cults , temples , and practices under the names of equivalent Greek deities . Interpretatio graeca may also describe non-Greeks ' interpretation of their own belief systems by comparison or assimilation with Greek models , as when Romans adapt Greek myths and iconography under the names of their own gods .   Interpretatio romana is comparative discourse in reference to ancient Roman religion and myth , as in the formation of a distinctive Gallo-Roman religion . Both the Romans and the Gauls reinterpreted Gallic religious traditions in relation to Roman models , particularly Imperial cult .   Jan Assmann considers the polytheistic approach to internationalizing gods as a form of `` intercultural translation '' :  The great achievement of polytheism is the articulation of a common semantic universe . ... The meaning of a deity is his or her specific character as it unfolded in myths , hymns , rites , and so on . This character makes a deity comparable to other deities with similar traits . The similarity of gods makes their names mutually translatable . ... The practice of translating the names of the gods created a concept of similarity and produced the idea or conviction that the gods are international .   Pliny the Elder expressed the `` translatability '' of deities as `` different names to different peoples '' ( nomina alia aliis gentibus ) . This capacity made possible the religious syncretism of the Hellenistic era and the pre-Christian Roman Empire .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

It was a resounding Roman defeat with heavy losses , and yet some 10,000 and more Romans , over 2.5 legions , survived on the field and retreated in order to Placentia ( Piacenza ) . In this battle , Hannibal got the better of the Romans by exercising the careful and innovative planning for which he was famous . The impetuous and short-sighted opposing general , the consul Tiberius Sempronius Longus , allowed himself to be provoked into a frontal assault under physically difficult circumstances and failed to see that he was being led into a trap .   The battle took place in the flat country of the Province of Piacenza on the left bank of the Trebbia River , a shallow , braided stream , not far south from its confluence ( from the south ) with the Po river . The battle is named for the river . Although the precise location is not known for certain , it is generally accepted as being visible from the Via Emilia , now paralleled by highway A21/E70 and a railroad trunk line , all of which come from Piacenza , a contemporaneously placed Roman colony ( though perhaps on an existing settlement ) , and cross the river north of where the Romans did in the battle . The area is possibly in the comune of Rottofreno at its main settlement , San Nicolò a Trebbia , in the vicinity of the coordinates given at the head of this article.Over the course of more than two millennia the precise configuration of the Trebbia and its streams as well as that of the Po have changed geologically . Although the location of Placentia is believed to be roughly the same , the original surfaces are under new layers of sediment and the locations of the bends , the depths and widths of the streams all have changed . Construction in the area also has been extensive , not to mention the turning over of the soil and obliteration of features by heavy bombing when the bridges and rail lines were destroyed in World War II .

48754,One of the major features of Zoroastrianism involves the messiah.,Zoroastrianism,"Zoroastrianism , or more natively Mazdayasna , is one of the world 's oldest extant religions , `` combining a cosmogonic dualism and eschatological monotheism in a manner unique -LSB- ... -RSB- among the major religions of the world '' . Ascribed to the teachings of the Iranian prophet Zoroaster ( or Zarathustra ) , it exalts a deity of wisdom , Ahura Mazda ( Wise Lord ) , as its Supreme Being . Major features of Zoroastrianism , such as messianism , heaven and hell , and free will have , some believe , influenced other religious systems , including Second Temple Judaism , Gnosticism , Christianity , and Islam . With possible roots dating back to the second millennium BCE , Zoroastrianism enters recorded history in the 5th-century BCE , and along with a Mithraic Median prototype and a Zurvanist Sassanid successor it served as the state religion of the pre-Islamic Iranian empires from around 600 BCE to 650 CE . Zoroastrianism was suppressed from the 7th century onwards following the Muslim conquest of Persia of 633-654 . Recent estimates place the current number of Zoroastrians at around 2.6 million , with most living in India and in Iran . Besides the Zoroastrian diaspora , the older Mithraic faith Yazdânism is still practised amongst Kurds .   The religious philosophy of Zoroaster divided the early Iranian gods of Proto-Indo-Iranian tradition . The most important texts of the religion are those of the Avesta , the Zoroastrians ' holy book . In Zoroastrianism , the creator Ahura Mazda , through the Spenta Mainyu ( Good Spirit , `` Bounteous Immortals '' ) is an all-good `` father '' of Asha ( Truth , `` order , justice '' ) , in opposition to Druj ( `` falsehood , deceit '' ) and no evil originates from `` him '' . `` He '' and his works are evident to humanity through the six primary Amesha Spentas and the host of other Yazatas , through whom worship of Mazda is ultimately directed . Spenta Mainyu adjoined unto `` truth '' oppose the Spirit 's opposite , Angra Mainyu and its forces born of Akəm Manah ( `` evil thinking '' ) .   Zoroastrianism has no major theological divisions , though it is not uniform ; modern-era influences having a significant impact on individual and local beliefs , practices , values and vocabulary , sometimes merging with tradition and in other cases displacing it . In Zoroastrianism , the purpose in life is to `` be among those who renew the world ... to make the world progress towards perfection '' . Its basic maxims include :   Humata , Hukhta , Huvarshta , which mean : Good Thoughts , Good Words , Good Deeds .  There is only one path and that is the path of Truth .  Do the right thing because it is the right thing to do , and then all beneficial rewards will come to you also .   The most important texts of the religion are those of the Avesta , which includes the writings of Zoroaster known as the Gathas , enigmatic poems that define the religion 's precepts , and the Yasna , the scripture . The full name by which Zoroaster addressed the deity is : Ahura , The Lord Creator , and Mazda , Supremely Wise . He proclaimed that there is only one God , the singularly creative and sustaining force of the Universe . He also stated that human beings are given a right of choice , and because of cause and effect are also responsible for the consequences of their choices . Zoroaster 's teachings focused on responsibility , and did not introduce a devil per se . The contesting force to Ahura Mazda was called Angra Mainyu , or angry spirit . Post-Zoroastrian scripture introduced the concept of Ahriman , the Devil , which was effectively a personification of Angra Mainyu .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Large Georgian communities are also present throughout Russia , Turkey , Greece , Iran , Ukraine , United States , and to a lesser extent throughout the European Union .   Georgians arose from the ancient Colchian and Iberian civilizations . After Christianization of Iberia by Saint Nino they became one of the first who embraced the faith of Jesus in the early 4th century and now the majority of Georgians are Eastern Orthodox Christians and most follow their national autocephalous Georgian Orthodox Church . There are also small Georgian Catholic and Muslim communities in Tbilisi and Adjara , as well as a significant number of irreligious Georgians .   A complex process of nation formation has resulted in a diverse set of geographic subgroups of Georgians , each with its characteristic traditions , manners , dialects and , in the case of Svans and Mingrelians , own regional languages . The Georgian language , with its own unique writing system and extensive written tradition , which goes back to the 5th century , is the official language of Georgia as well as the language of education of all Georgians living in the country .   Located on the crossroads of predominantly Christian Europe and Muslim Western Asia , Georgian people have maintained their Christian identity in the face of great pressure from neighboring Muslim empires . By the early 11th century they formed a unified Kingdom of Georgia and inaugurated the Georgian Golden Age , a height of political and cultural power of the nation . This lasted until being weakened by Mongol invasions , as well as internal divisions following the death of George V the Brilliant , the last of the great kings of Georgia . Thereafter and throughout the early modern period Georgians became politically fractured and fell into decline due to the onslaught of various hostile empires , including the Ottoman Empire and successive dynasties of Persia . To ensure Georgia 's survival , in 1783 Heraclius II of Georgia forged an alliance with the Russian Empire , which Georgians viewed as a replacement for their fallen traditional ally -- Byzantine Empire . The Russo-Georgian alliance , however , backfired as Russia was unwilling to fulfill the terms of the treaty , proceeding to annex the troubled kingdom in 1801 . Georgians briefly reasserted their independence from Russia under the First Georgian Republic from 1918-1921 , and finally , in 1991 from the Soviet Union .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Classic symptoms include gastrointestinal problems such as chronic diarrhoea , abdominal distention , malabsorption , loss of appetite , and among children failure to grow normally . This often begins between six months and two years of age . Non-classic symptoms are more common , especially in people older than two years . There may be mild or absent gastrointestinal symptoms , a wide number of symptoms involving any part of the body , or no obvious symptoms . Coeliac disease was first described in childhood ; however , it may develop at any age . It is associated with other autoimmune diseases , such as diabetes mellitus type 1 and thyroiditis , among others .   Coeliac disease is caused by a reaction to gluten , which are various proteins found in wheat and in other grains such as barley , and rye . Moderate quantities of oats , free of contamination with other gluten-containing grains , are usually tolerated . The occurrence of problems may depend on the variety of oat . Upon exposure to gluten , an abnormal immune response may lead to the production of several different autoantibodies that can affect a number of different organs .

145012,Coeliac disease may result in increased risk of cancer.,Coeliac_disease,"Coeliac disease , also spelled celiac disease , is a long term autoimmune disorder primarily affecting the small intestine that occurs in people who are genetically predisposed . Classic symptoms include gastrointestinal problems such as chronic diarrhoea , abdominal distention , malabsorption , loss of appetite , and among children failure to grow normally . This often begins between six months and two years of age . Non-classic symptoms are more common , especially in people older than two years . There may be mild or absent gastrointestinal symptoms , a wide number of symptoms involving any part of the body , or no obvious symptoms . Coeliac disease was first described in childhood ; however , it may develop at any age . It is associated with other autoimmune diseases , such as diabetes mellitus type 1 and thyroiditis , among others .   Coeliac disease is caused by a reaction to gluten , which are various proteins found in wheat and in other grains such as barley , and rye . Moderate quantities of oats , free of contamination with other gluten-containing grains , are usually tolerated . The occurrence of problems may depend on the variety of oat . Upon exposure to gluten , an abnormal immune response may lead to the production of several different autoantibodies that can affect a number of different organs . In the small-bowel this causes an inflammatory reaction and may produce shortening of the villi lining the small intestine ( villous atrophy ) . This affects the absorption of nutrients , frequently leading to anaemia .

Tennessee is the 36th largest and the 16th most populous of the 50 United States . Tennessee is bordered by Kentucky and Virginia to the north , North Carolina to the east , Georgia , Alabama , and Mississippi to the south , and Arkansas and Missouri to the west . The Appalachian Mountains dominate the eastern part of the state , and the Mississippi River forms the state 's western border . Nashville is the state 's largest city , with a population of 660,388 . Tennessee 's second largest city is Memphis , which has a population of 652,717 .   The state of Tennessee is rooted in the Watauga Association , a 1772 frontier pact generally regarded as the first constitutional government west of the Appalachians . What is now Tennessee was initially part of North Carolina , and later part of the Southwest Territory . Tennessee was admitted to the Union as the 16th state on June 1 , 1796 . Tennessee was the last state to leave the Union and join the Confederacy at the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 . Occupied by Union forces from 1862 , it was the first state to be readmitted to the Union at the end of the war .   Tennessee furnished more soldiers for the Confederate Army than any other state besides Virginia , and more soldiers for the Union Army than the rest of the Confederacy combined . Beginning during Reconstruction , it had competitive party politics , but a Democratic takeover in the late 1880s resulted in passage of disfranchisement laws that excluded most blacks and many poor whites from voting . This sharply reduced competition in politics in the state until after passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-20th century . In the 20th century , Tennessee transitioned from an agrarian economy to a more diversified economy , aided by massive federal investment in the Tennessee Valley Authority and , in the early 1940s , the city of Oak Ridge . This city was established to house the Manhattan Project 's uranium enrichment facilities , helping to build the world 's first atomic bomb , which was used during World War II .   Tennessee 's major industries include agriculture , manufacturing , and tourism . Poultry , soybeans , and cattle are the state 's primary agricultural products , and major manufacturing exports include chemicals , transportation equipment , and electrical equipment . The Great Smoky Mountains National Park , the nation 's most visited national park , is headquartered in the eastern part of the state , and a section of the Appalachian Trail roughly follows the Tennessee-North Carolina border . Other major tourist attractions include the Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga ; Dollywood in Pigeon Forge ; Ripley 's Aquarium of the Smokies and Ober Gatlinburg in Gatlinburg ; the Parthenon , the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum , and Ryman Auditorium in Nashville ; the Jack Daniel 's Distillery in Lynchburg ; Elvis Presley 's Graceland residence and tomb , the Memphis Zoo , and the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis ; and Bristol Motor Speedway in Bristol .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

He was concurrently Duke and prince-elector of Brunswick-Lüneburg ( `` Hanover '' ) in the Holy Roman Empire until his promotion to King of Hanover on 12 October 1814 . He was the third British monarch of the House of Hanover , but unlike his two predecessors he was born in Britain , spoke English as his first language , and never visited Hanover .   His life and with it his reign , which were longer than any other British monarch before him , were marked by a series of military conflicts involving his kingdoms , much of the rest of Europe , and places farther afield in Africa , the Americas and Asia . Early in his reign , Great Britain defeated France in the Seven Years ' War , becoming the dominant European power in North America and India . However , many of Britain 's American colonies were soon lost in the American War of Independence . Further wars against revolutionary and Napoleonic France from 1793 concluded in the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 .   In the later part of his life , George III had recurrent , and eventually permanent , mental illness . Although it has since been suggested that he had the blood disease porphyria , the cause of his illness remains unknown . After a final relapse in 1810 , a regency was established , and George III 's eldest son , George , Prince of Wales , ruled as Prince Regent . On George III 's death , the Prince Regent succeeded his father as George IV .   Historical analysis of George III 's life has gone through a `` kaleidoscope of changing views '' that have depended heavily on the prejudices of his biographers and the sources available to them . Until it was reassessed in the second half of the 20th century , his reputation in the United States was one of a tyrant ; and in Britain he became `` the scapegoat for the failure of imperialism '' .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines , the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves .   Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines , perhaps the oldest through its inclusion of astronomy . Over the last two millennia , physics was a part of natural philosophy along with chemistry , biology , and certain branches of mathematics , but during the scientific revolution in the 17th century , the natural sciences emerged as unique research programs in their own right . Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research , such as biophysics and quantum chemistry , and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined . New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms of other sciences while opening new avenues of research in areas such as mathematics and philosophy .   Physics also makes significant contributions through advances in new technologies that arise from theoretical breakthroughs . For example , advances in the understanding of electromagnetism or nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products that have dramatically transformed modern-day society , such as television , computers , domestic appliances , and nuclear weapons ; advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization , and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus .

19194,Pulmonary embolism is indicated by high blood oxygen levels.,Pulmonary_embolism,"Pulmonary embolism ( PE ) is a blockage of an artery in the lungs by a substance that has traveled from elsewhere in the body through the bloodstream ( embolism ) . Symptoms of a PE may include shortness of breath , chest pain particularly upon breathing in , and coughing up blood . Symptoms of a blood clot in the leg may also be present such as a red , warm , swollen , and painful leg . Signs of a PE include low blood oxygen levels , rapid breathing , rapid heart rate , and sometimes a mild fever . Severe cases can lead to passing out , abnormally low blood pressure , and sudden death .   PE usually results from a blood clot in the leg that travels to the lung . The risk of blood clots is increased by cancer , prolonged bed rest , smoking , stroke , certain genetic conditions , estrogen-based medication , pregnancy , obesity , and after some types of surgery . A small proportion of cases are due to the embolization of air , fat , or amniotic fluid . Diagnosis is based on signs and symptoms in combination with test results . If the risk is low a blood test known as a D-dimer will rule out the condition . Otherwise a CT pulmonary angiography , lung ventilation/perfusion scan , or ultrasound of the legs may confirm the diagnosis . Together deep vein thrombosis and PE are known as venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) .   Efforts to prevent PE include beginning to move as soon as possible after surgery , lower leg exercises during periods of sitting , and the use of blood thinners after some types of surgery . Treatment is typically with blood thinners such as heparin or warfarin . Often these are recommended for six months or longer . Severe cases may require thrombolysis using medication such as tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) , or may require surgery such as a pulmonary thrombectomy . If blood thinners are not appropriate , a vena cava filter may be used .   Pulmonary emboli affect about 430,000 people each year in Europe . In the United States between 300,000 and 600,000 cases occur each year , which results in between 50,000 and 200,000 deaths . Rates are similar in males and females .

The building was opened in 2010 as part of a new development called Downtown Dubai . It is designed to be the centrepiece of large-scale , mixed-use development . The decision to construct the building is reportedly based on the government 's decision to diversify from an oil-based economy , and for Dubai to gain international recognition . The building was named in honour of the ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the United Arab Emirates , Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan ; Abu Dhabi and the UAE government lent Dubai money to pay its debts . The building broke numerous height records , including its designation as the tallest tower in the world .   Burj Khalifa was designed by Adrian Smith , then of Skidmore , Owings & Merrill ( SOM ) , whose firm designed the Willis Tower and One World Trade Center . Hyder Consulting was chosen to be the supervising engineer with NORR Group Consultants International Limited chosen to supervise the architecture of the project . The design is derived from the Islamic architecture of the region , such as in the Great Mosque of Samarra . The Y-shaped tripartite floor geometry is designed to optimize residential and hotel space . A buttressed central core and wings are used to support the height of the building . Although this design was derived from Tower Palace III , the Burj Khalifa 's central core houses all vertical transportation with the exception of egress stairs within each of the wings . The structure also features a cladding system which is designed to withstand Dubai 's hot summer temperatures . It contains a total of 57 elevators and 8 escalators .   Critical reception to Burj Khalifa has been generally positive , and the building has received many awards . However , the labour issues during construction were controversial , since the building was built primarily by migrant workers from South Asia with several allegations of mistreatment . Poor working conditions are common , as the result of the lack of minimum wage laws in the United Arab Emirates . Several instances of suicides have been reported , which is not uncommon for migrant construction workers in Dubai despite safety precautions in place .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

129767,George Harrisongot married in 1966.,George_Harrison,"George Harrison , ( 25 February 1943 -- 29 November 2001 ) was an English guitarist , singer , songwriter , and music and film producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles . Often referred to as `` the quiet Beatle '' , Harrison embraced Hinduism and helped broaden the horizons of his fellow Beatles as well as their Western audience by incorporating Indian instrumentation in their music . Although most of the Beatles ' songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney , most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions . His songs for the group included `` Taxman '' , `` Within You Without You '' , `` While My Guitar Gently Weeps '' , `` Here Comes the Sun '' and `` Something '' , the last of which became the Beatles ' second-most covered song .   Harrison 's earliest musical influences included George Formby and Django Reinhardt ; Carl Perkins , Chet Atkins and Chuck Berry were subsequent influences . By 1965 he had begun to lead the Beatles into folk rock through his interest in the Byrds and Bob Dylan , and towards Indian classical music through his use of the sitar on `` Norwegian Wood ( This Bird Has Flown ) '' . Having initiated the band 's embracing of transcendental meditation in 1967 , he subsequently developed an association with the Hare Krishna movement . After the band 's break-up in 1970 , Harrison released the triple album All Things Must Pass , a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single , `` My Sweet Lord '' , and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist , the slide guitar . He also organised the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh with Indian musician Ravi Shankar , a precursor for later benefit concerts such as Live Aid . In his role as a music and film producer , Harrison produced acts signed to the Beatles ' Apple record label before founding Dark Horse Records in 1974 and co-founding HandMade Films in 1978 .   Harrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer , and in 1988 co-founded the platinum-selling supergroup the Traveling Wilburys . A prolific recording artist , he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by Badfinger , Ronnie Wood and Billy Preston , and collaborated on songs and music with Dylan , Eric Clapton , Ringo Starr and Tom Petty , among others . Rolling Stone magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the `` 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time '' . He is a two-time Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee -- as a member of the Beatles in 1988 , and ( posthumously ) for his solo career in 2004 .   Harrison 's first marriage , to model Pattie Boyd in 1966 , ended in divorce in 1977 . The following year he married Olivia Harrison ( née Arias ) , with whom he had one son , Dhani . Harrison died in 2001 , aged 58 , from lung cancer . He was cremated and his ashes were scattered in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers in India , in a private ceremony according to Hindu tradition . He left an estate of almost # 100 million .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ
35009,Mount Hood is in the Southwest.,Mount_Hood,"Mount Hood , called Wy'east by the Multnomah tribe , is a potentially active stratovolcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc of northern Oregon . It was formed by a subduction zone on the Pacific coast and rests in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States . It is located about 50 mi east-southeast of Portland , on the border between Clackamas and Hood River counties . In addition to being Oregon 's highest mountain , it is one of the loftiest mountains in the nation based on its prominence .   The height assigned to Mount Hood 's snow-covered peak has varied over its history . Modern sources point to three different heights : 11249 ft , a 1991 adjustment of a 1986 measurement by the U.S. National Geodetic Survey ( NGS ) , 11240 ft based on a 1993 scientific expedition , and 11239 ft of slightly older origin . The peak is home to 12 named glaciers and snowfields . It is the highest point in Oregon and the fourth highest in the Cascade Range .  Mount Hood is considered the Oregon volcano most likely to erupt ,  though based on its history , an explosive eruption is unlikely . Still , the odds of an eruption in the next 30 years are estimated at between 3 and 7 percent , so the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) characterizes it as `` potentially active '' , but the mountain is informally considered dormant .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Its population is approximately 800,000 people . Aden 's ancient , natural harbour lies in the crater of a dormant volcano which now forms a peninsula , joined to the mainland by a low isthmus . This harbour , Front Bay , was first used by the ancient Kingdom of Awsan between the 5th and 7th centuries BC . The modern harbor is on the other side of the peninsula . Aden gives its name to the Gulf of Aden .   Aden consists of a number of distinct sub-centers : Crater , the original port city ; Ma'alla , the modern port ; Tawahi , known as `` Steamer Point '' in the colonial period ; and the resorts of Gold Mohur . Khormaksar , located on the isthmus that connects Aden proper with the mainland , includes the city 's diplomatic missions , the main offices of Aden University , and Aden International Airport ( the former British Royal Air Force station RAF Khormaksar ) , Yemen 's second biggest airport . On the mainland are the sub-centers of Sheikh Othman , a former oasis area ; Al-Mansura , a town planned by the British ; and Madinat ash-Sha ' b ( formerly Madinat al-Itihad ) , the site designated as the capital of the South Arabian Federation and now home to a large power/desalinization facility and additional faculties of Aden University .   Aden encloses the eastern side of a vast , natural harbor that comprises the modern port . The volcanic peninsula of Little Aden forms a near-mirror image , enclosing the harbor and port on the western side . Little Aden became the site of the oil refinery and tanker port . Both were established and operated by British Petroleum until they were turned over to Yemeni government ownership and control in 1978 .   Aden was the capital of the People 's Democratic Republic of Yemen until that country 's unification with the Yemen Arab Republic in 1990 , and again briefly served as Yemen 's temporary capital during the aftermath of the 2014 -- 15 Yemeni coup d'état , as declared by President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi after he fled the Houthi occupation of Sana'a . From March to July 2015 , the Battle of Aden raged between Houthis and loyalists to President Hadi . Water , food , and medical supplies ran short in the city . On 14 July , the Saudi Army launched an offensive to retake Aden for Hadi 's government . Within three days the Houthis had been removed from the city .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Rolling Stone called her `` one of the greatest songwriters ever '' , and AllMusic has stated , `` When the dust settles , Joni Mitchell may stand as the most important and influential female recording artist of the late 20th century '' . Drawing from folk , pop , rock and jazz , Mitchell 's songs often reflect social and environmental ideals as well as her feelings about romance , confusion , disillusionment and joy .   Mitchell began singing in small nightclubs in Saskatoon , Saskatchewan and western Canada before busking in the streets and shoddy nightclubs of Toronto . In 1965 , she moved to the United States and began touring . Some of her original songs ( `` Urge for Going '' , `` Chelsea Morning '' , `` Both Sides , Now '' , `` The Circle Game '' ) were covered by folk singers , allowing her to sign with Reprise Records and record her debut album in 1968 . Settling in Southern California , Mitchell , with popular songs like `` Big Yellow Taxi '' and `` Woodstock '' , helped define an era and a generation . Her 1971 recording Blue was rated the 30th best album ever made in Rolling Stone 's list of the `` 500 Greatest Albums of All Time '' , the highest entry by a female artist . Mitchell switched labels and began moving toward jazz rhythms by way of lush pop textures on 1974 's Court and Spark , her best-selling LP , featuring the radio hits `` Help Me '' and `` Free Man in Paris '' .   Around 1975 her vocal range began to shift from mezzo-soprano to more of a wide-ranging contralto . Her distinctive piano and open-tuned guitar compositions also grew more harmonically and rhythmically complex as she explored jazz , melding it with influences of rock and roll , R&B , classical music , and non-western beats .

8577,The Dodo has been depicted with a naked head and arm.,Dodo,"The dodo ( Raphus cucullatus ) is an extinct flightless bird that was endemic to the island of Mauritius , east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean . The dodo 's closest genetic relative was the also extinct Rodrigues solitaire , the two forming the subfamily Raphinae of the family of pigeons and doves . The closest living relative of the dodo is the Nicobar pigeon . A white dodo was once thought to have existed on the nearby island of Réunion , but this is now thought to have been confusion based on the Réunion ibis and paintings of white dodos .   Subfossil remains show the dodo was about 1 m tall and may have weighed 10.6 - . The dodo 's appearance in life is evidenced only by drawings , paintings , and written accounts from the 17th century . Because these vary considerably , and because only some illustrations are known to have been drawn from live specimens , its exact appearance in life remains unresolved , and little is known about its behaviour . Though the dodo has historically been considered fat and clumsy , it is now thought to have been well-adapted for its ecosystem . It has been depicted with brownish-grey plumage , yellow feet , a tuft of tail feathers , a grey , naked head , and a black , yellow , and green beak . It used gizzard stones to help digest its food , which is thought to have included fruits , and its main habitat is believed to have been the woods in the drier coastal areas of Mauritius . One account states its clutch consisted of a single egg . It is presumed that the dodo became flightless because of the ready availability of abundant food sources and a relative absence of predators on Mauritius .   The first recorded mention of the dodo was by Dutch sailors in 1598 . In the following years , the bird was hunted by sailors and invasive species , while its habitat was being destroyed . The last widely accepted sighting of a dodo was in 1662 . Its extinction was not immediately noticed , and some considered it to be a mythical creature . In the 19th century , research was conducted on a small quantity of remains of four specimens that had been brought to Europe in the early 17th century . Among these is a dried head , the only soft tissue of the dodo that remains today . Since then , a large amount of subfossil material has been collected on Mauritius , mostly from the Mare aux Songes swamp . The extinction of the dodo within less than a century of its discovery called attention to the previously unrecognised problem of human involvement in the disappearance of entire species . The dodo achieved widespread recognition from its role in the story of Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland , and it has since become a fixture in popular culture , often as a symbol of extinction and obsolescence .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

62680,A near-Earth object is a dwarf planet.,Near-Earth_object,"A near-Earth object ( NEO ) is any small Solar System body whose orbit brings it into proximity with Earth . By definition , a solar system body is a NEO if its closest approach to the Sun ( perihelion ) is less than 1.3 astronomical unit ( AU ) . NEOs include more than fourteen thousand near-Earth asteroids ( NEAs ) , more than one hundred near-Earth comets ( NECs ) , and a number of solar-orbiting spacecraft and meteoroids , large enough to be tracked in space before striking the Earth . It is now widely accepted that collisions in the past have had a significant role in shaping the geological and biological history of the Earth . NEOs have become of increased interest since the 1980s because of increased awareness of the potential danger some of the asteroids or comets pose , and mitigations are being researched . In January 2016 , NASA announced the Planetary Defense Coordination Office to track NEOs larger than 30 to 50 meters in diameter and coordinate an effective threat response and mitigation effort .   NEAs have orbits that lie partly between 0.983 and 1.3 AU away from the Sun . When a NEA is detected it is submitted to the IAU 's Minor Planet Center for cataloging . Some NEAs orbits intersect that of Earth 's so they pose a collision danger . The United States , European Union , and other nations are currently scanning for NEOs in an effort called Spaceguard .   In the United States and since 1998 , NASA has a congressional mandate to catalogue all NEOs that are at least 1 kilometer wide , as the impact of such an object would be globally catastrophic . In 2006 , it was estimated that 20 % of the mandated objects had not yet been found . In 2011 , largely as a result of NEOWISE , it was estimated that 93 % of the NEAs larger than 1 km had been found and that only about 70 remained to be discovered . , there have been 875 NEAs larger than 1 km discovered , of which 157 are potentially hazardous . The inventory is much less complete for smaller objects , which still have potential for large scale , though not global , damage .   Potentially hazardous objects ( PHOs ) are currently defined based on parameters that measure the object 's potential to make threatening close approaches to the Earth . Mostly objects with an Earth minimum orbit intersection distance ( MOID ) of 0.05 AU or less and an absolute magnitude ( H ) of 22.0 or brighter ( a rough indicator of large size ) are considered PHOs . Objects that can not approach closer to the Earth ( i.e. MOID ) than 0.05 AU , or are smaller than about 150 m ( 500 ft ) in diameter ( i.e. H = 22.0 with assumed albedo of 13 % ) , are not considered PHOs . NASA 's catalog for near-Earth objects also includes the approach distances of asteroids and comets measured in lunar distances , and this usage has become a common unit of measure used by the news media in discussing these objects .   Some NEOs are of special interest because they can be physically explored with lower mission velocity than for even the Moon , due to their combination of low velocity with respect to Earth ( ΔV ) and weak gravity , so they may present interesting scientific opportunities both for direct geochemical and astronomical investigation , and as potentially economical sources of extraterrestrial materials for human exploitation . This makes them an attractive target for exploration . As of 2016 , three near-Earth objects have been visited by spacecraft .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

He was concurrently Duke and prince-elector of Brunswick-Lüneburg ( `` Hanover '' ) in the Holy Roman Empire until his promotion to King of Hanover on 12 October 1814 . He was the third British monarch of the House of Hanover , but unlike his two predecessors he was born in Britain , spoke English as his first language , and never visited Hanover .   His life and with it his reign , which were longer than any other British monarch before him , were marked by a series of military conflicts involving his kingdoms , much of the rest of Europe , and places farther afield in Africa , the Americas and Asia . Early in his reign , Great Britain defeated France in the Seven Years ' War , becoming the dominant European power in North America and India . However , many of Britain 's American colonies were soon lost in the American War of Independence . Further wars against revolutionary and Napoleonic France from 1793 concluded in the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 .   In the later part of his life , George III had recurrent , and eventually permanent , mental illness . Although it has since been suggested that he had the blood disease porphyria , the cause of his illness remains unknown . After a final relapse in 1810 , a regency was established , and George III 's eldest son , George , Prince of Wales , ruled as Prince Regent . On George III 's death , the Prince Regent succeeded his father as George IV .   Historical analysis of George III 's life has gone through a `` kaleidoscope of changing views '' that have depended heavily on the prejudices of his biographers and the sources available to them . Until it was reassessed in the second half of the 20th century , his reputation in the United States was one of a tyrant ; and in Britain he became `` the scapegoat for the failure of imperialism '' .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

A medium-sized market town in the medieval period , Birmingham grew to international prominence in the 18th century at the heart of the Midlands Enlightenment and subsequent Industrial Revolution , which saw the town at the forefront of worldwide advances in science , technology , and economic development , producing a series of innovations that laid many of the foundations of modern industrial society . By 1791 it was being hailed as `` the first manufacturing town in the world '' . Birmingham 's distinctive economic profile , with thousands of small workshops practising a wide variety of specialised and highly skilled trades , encouraged exceptional levels of creativity and innovation and provided a diverse and resilient economic base for industrial prosperity that was to last into the final quarter of the 20th century . Perhaps the most important invention in British history , the industrial steam engine , was invented in Birmingham . Its resulting high level of social mobility also fostered a culture of broad-based political radicalism , that under leaders from Thomas Attwood to Joseph Chamberlain was to give it a political influence unparalleled in Britain outside London , and a pivotal role in the development of British democracy . From the summer of 1940 to the spring of 1943 , Birmingham was bombed heavily by the German Luftwaffe in what is known as the Birmingham Blitz . The damage done to the city 's infrastructure , in addition to a deliberate policy of demolition and new building by planners , led to extensive demolition and redevelopment in subsequent decades .   Today Birmingham 's economy is dominated by the service sector . The city is a major international commercial centre , ranked as a gamma + world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ; and an important transport , retail , events and conference hub .

The album 's diverse sounds include tape loops and backwards recordings on the psychedelic `` Tomorrow Never Knows '' , a classical string octet on `` Eleanor Rigby '' , and Indian-music backing on `` Love You To '' . The album was reduced to eleven songs by Capitol Records in North America , where three of its tracks instead appeared on the June 1966 release Yesterday and Today . Revolver was the last Beatles album to be subjected to Capitol 's policy of altering the band 's intended running order and content .   The Beatles recorded the album following a three-month break from professional commitments at the start of 1966 , and during a period when London was feted as the era 's cultural capital . The songs reflect the influence of psychedelic drugs such as LSD and the increasing sophistication of the Beatles ' lyrics to address themes including death and transcendence from material concerns . With no thoughts of reproducing their new material in concert , the band made liberal use of studio techniques such as varispeeding , reversed tapes , close audio miking and automatic double tracking ( ADT ) , in addition to employing musical instrumentation outside of their standard live set-up . Some of the changes in studio practice introduced by Revolver , particularly ADT , were soon adopted throughout the recording industry . The sessions also produced a non-album single , `` Paperback Writer '' backed with `` Rain '' , for which the Beatles filmed their first on-location promotional films .   In the UK , Revolver fourteen tracks were released to radio stations throughout July 1966 , with the music signifying what author Ian MacDonald later described as `` a second pop revolution -- one which while galvanising their existing rivals and inspiring many new ones , left all of them far behind '' . The album 's US release coincided with the Beatles ' final concert tour , which was marred by the controversy surrounding John Lennon 's remark that the band had become `` more popular than Jesus '' . The record topped the UK Albums Chart for seven weeks and America 's Billboard Top LPs list for six weeks . Together with the children 's novelty song `` Yellow Submarine '' , `` Eleanor Rigby '' became an international hit when issued as a double A-side single .   Revolvers cover artwork , designed by Klaus Voormann , won the 1967 Grammy Award for Best Album Cover , Graphic Arts . The album was influential in advancing principles espoused by the 1960s counterculture and in inspiring the development of pop music into subgenres such as psychedelic rock , electronica , progressive rock and world music . With the restoration of the three omitted tracks for its international CD release in 1987 , many music critics recognise Revolver as the Beatles ' best album , surpassing Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band . The album was ranked first in Colin Larkin 's book All-Time Top 1000 Albums and third in Rolling Stone magazine 's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time . In 2013 , after the British Phonographic Industry had changed its sales award rules , Revolver was certified platinum in the UK . The album has been certified 5 × platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Led by evil genius and supervillain Ernst Stavro Blofeld , the international organisation first formally appeared in the novel Thunderball ( 1961 ) and in the film Dr. No ( 1962 ) . As an NGO , SPECTRE is not aligned to any nation or political ideology , enabling the later Bond books and Bond films to be regarded as somewhat apolitical though the former Gestapo members are a clear sign of Fleming 's warning of the Nazi fascists surviving after the Second World War first detailed in the novel Moonraker ( 1954 ) . SPECTRE began in the novels as a small group of criminals but became a vast international organisation with its own SPECTRE Island training base in the films , to replace the Soviet SMERSH .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

218114,"The Indian National Congress was founded in 1885, during the British Raj.",Indian_National_Congress,"The Indian National Congress ( INC , often called Congress ) is a broad-based political party in India . Founded in 1885 , the Congress led India to independence from Great Britain , and powerfully influenced other anti-colonial nationalist movements in the British Empire . After India 's independence in 1947 , the Congress formed the government at center in most instances , and also many regional state governments . The Congress is a secular , left-of-centre , party . Although it did not fare well in the last general elections in India in 2014 , it remains one of two major , nationwide , political parties in India , along with the right-wing , Hindu nationalist , Bhartiya Janata Party ( BJP ) .   The Congress was the first modern nationalist movement to emerge in the British Empire in Asia and Africa . It was founded in Bombay in late December 1885 , during the British Raj in India . Its principal founders were , Allan Octavian Hume ( a former administrator of Etawah district , North-Western Provinces , and pioneering ornithologist of India ) , as well as William Wedderburn , Pherozeshah Mehta , Dadabhai Naoroji , Dinshaw Wacha , and others . From the late 19th-century , and especially after 1920 , under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi , Congress became the principal leader of the Indian independence movement , with over 15 million members and over 70 million participants .   After independence in 1947 , Congress became India 's dominant political party ; , in the 15 general elections since independence , it has won an outright majority on six occasions and has led the ruling coalition a further four times , heading the central government for 49 years . There have been seven Congress Prime Ministers , the first being Jawaharlal Nehru ( 1947 -- 64 ) , and the most recent Manmohan Singh ( 2004 -- 14 ) . The party 's social liberal platform is generally considered to be on the centre-left of Indian politics .   From 2004 to 2014 , the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance , a coalition of several regional parties , formed the Indian government and was headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh . As of March 2017 , the party is in power in five states : Punjab , Himachal Pradesh , Karnataka , Meghalaya and Mizoram . In Bihar , it is a part of the ruling coalition . The Congress has previously directly ruled Andhra Pradesh , Tamil Nadu , Gujarat , Madhya Pradesh , Rajasthan , Uttar Pradesh and Goa . In the 2014 general election , the Congress had its poorest post-independence general election performance , winning only 44 seats of the 543-member house .   The Congress ' social policy is based upon the Gandhian principle of Sarvodaya -- the lifting up of all sections of society -- which involves the improvement of the lives of economically underprivileged and socially marginalised people . The party primarily endorses social liberalism -- seeking to balance individual liberty and social justice , and secularism -- asserting the right to be free from religious rule and teachings .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Located in the Pacific Ocean , it lies off the eastern coast of the Asian mainland , and stretches from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Taiwan in the southwest .   The kanji that make up Japan 's name mean `` sun origin '' . 日 can be read as ni and means sun , while 本 can be read as hon , or pon and means origin . Japan is often referred to by the famous epithet `` Land of the Rising Sun '' in reference to its Japanese name .   Japan is a stratovolcanic archipelago consisting of about 6,852 islands . The four largest are Honshu , Hokkaido , Kyushu and Shikoku , which make up about ninety-seven percent of Japan 's land area and often are referred to as home islands . The country is divided into 47 prefectures in eight regions ; Hokkaido being the northernmost prefecture and Okinawa being the southernmost one . The population of 127 million is the world 's tenth largest . Japanese people make up 98.5 % of Japan 's total population . Approximately 9.1 million people live in the city of Tokyo , the capital of Japan .   Archaeological research indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period . The first written mention of Japan is in Chinese history texts from the 1st century AD . Influence from other regions , mainly China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , has characterized Japan 's history . From the 12th century until 1868 , Japan was ruled by successive feudal military shoguns who ruled in the name of the Emperor .   Japan entered into a long period of isolation in the early 17th century , which was ended in 1853 when a United States fleet pressured Japan to open to the West . After nearly two decades of internal conflict and insurrection , the Imperial Court regained its political power in 1868 through the help of several clans from Chōshū and Satsuma , and the Empire of Japan was established . In the late 19th and early 20th centuries , victories in the First Sino-Japanese War , the Russo-Japanese War and World War I allowed Japan to expand its empire during a period of increasing militarism .   The Second Sino-Japanese War of 1937 expanded into part of World War II in 1941 , which came to an end in 1945 following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Japanese surrender . Since adopting its revised constitution on May 3 , 1947 during the occupation by the SCAP , Japan has maintained a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy with an Emperor and an elected legislature called the National Diet .   Japan is a member of the UN , the OECD , the G7 , the G8 , and the G20 and is considered a great power . The country has the world 's third-largest economy by nominal GDP and the world 's fourth-largest economy by purchasing power parity . It is also the world 's fourth-largest exporter and fourth-largest importer . The country benefits from a highly skilled workforce and is among the most highly educated countries in the world , with one of the highest percentages of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree .   Although Japan has officially renounced its right to declare war , it maintains a modern military with the world 's eighth-largest military budget , used for self-defense and peacekeeping roles . Japan is a developed country with a very high standard of living and Human Development Index . Its population enjoys the highest life expectancy and the third lowest infant mortality rate in the world .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Serge Berstein writes that Gaullism is `` neither a doctrine nor a political ideology '' and can not be considered either left or right . Rather , `` considering its historical progression , it is a pragmatic exercise of power that is neither free from contradictions nor of concessions to momentary necessity , even if the imperious word of the general gives to the practice of Gaullism the allure of a program that seems profound and fully realized . '' Gaullism is `` a peculiarly French phenomenon , without doubt the quintessential French political phenomenon of the twentieth century . ''   Lawrence D. Kritzman writes that Gaullism may be seen as a form of French patriotism in the tradition of Jules Michelet . He writes : `` Aligned on the political spectrum with the Right , Gaullism was committed nevertheless to the republican values of the Revolution , and so distanced itself from the particularist ambitions of the traditional Right and its xenophobic causes , Gaullism saw as its mission the affirmation of national sovereignty and unity , which was diametrically opposed to the divisiveness created by the leftist commitment to class struggle .

A member of the Republican Party , he was previously a congressman , ambassador , and Director of Central Intelligence . He is the oldest living former President and Vice President . Since 2000 , Bush has often been referred to as `` George H. W. Bush '' , `` Bush 41 '' , `` Bush the Elder '' , or `` George Bush Senior '' to distinguish him from his eldest son , George W. Bush , who became the 43rd President of the United States after the 2000 election .   Bush was born in Milton , Massachusetts , to Prescott Bush and Dorothy Walker Bush . Following the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 , Bush postponed his university studies , enlisted in the U.S. Navy on his 18th birthday , and became the youngest aviator in the U.S. Navy at the time . He served until the end of the war , then attended Yale University . Graduating in 1948 , he moved his family to West Texas and entered the oil business , becoming a millionaire by the age of 40 . Bush became involved in politics soon after founding his own oil company , and he won election to the House of Representatives in 1966 . In 1971 , President Richard Nixon appointed Bush as Ambassador to the United Nations , and in 1973 , Bush became the Chairman of the Republican National Committee . The following year , President Gerald Ford appointed Bush as the ambassador to the People 's Republic of China , and later reassigned Bush to the position of Director of Central Intelligence . Bush ran for president in 1980 but was defeated in the Republican primary by Ronald Reagan . Reagan chose Bush as his running mate , and Bush became vice president after the Reagan -- Bush ticket won the 1980 election . During his eight-year tenure as vice president , Bush headed administration task forces on deregulation and fighting the `` War on Drugs '' .   In 1988 , Bush ran a successful campaign to succeed Reagan as President , defeating Democratic opponent Michael Dukakis . Foreign policy drove the Bush presidency : military operations were conducted in Panama and the Persian Gulf ; the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 , and the Soviet Union dissolved two years later . Though the agreement was not ratified until after he left office , Bush also signed the North American Free Trade Agreement , which created a trade bloc consisting of the United States , Canada , and Mexico . Domestically , Bush reneged on a 1988 campaign promise and , after a struggle with Congress , signed an increase in taxes that Congress had passed . In the wake of a weak recovery from an economic recession , along with continuing budget deficits and the diminution of foreign politics as a major issue in a post-Cold War political climate , he lost the 1992 presidential election to Democrat Bill Clinton .   Bush left office in 1993 . His presidential library was dedicated in 1997 , and he has been active -- often alongside Bill Clinton -- in various humanitarian activities . With George W. Bush 's victory in the 2000 presidential election , Bush and his son became the second father-son combination to serve as president , following John Adams and John Quincy Adams . Another member of the Bush family , Bush 's second son Jeb Bush , served as the 43rd Governor of Florida ( 1999 -- 2007 ) and sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Julianne Moore and Steve Buscemi also star , with David Huddleston , John Turturro , Philip Seymour Hoffman , Sam Elliott , Tara Reid , David Thewlis and Flea appearing in supporting roles .   The film is loosely inspired by the work of Raymond Chandler . Joel Coen stated : `` We wanted to do a Chandler kind of story -- how it moves episodically , and deals with the characters trying to unravel a mystery , as well as having a hopelessly complex plot that 's ultimately unimportant . '' The original score was composed by Carter Burwell , a longtime collaborator of the Coen brothers .   The Big Lebowski was a disappointment at the U.S. box office and received mixed reviews at the time of its release . Over time , however , reviews have become largely positive , and the film has become a cult favorite , noted for its idiosyncratic characters , dream sequences , unconventional dialogue , and eclectic soundtrack . In 2014 , the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress , being deemed `` culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant '' .

He was born in the small town of Saint-Gervais-les-Trois-Clochers in the district of Châtellerault , near the city of Loudun . He could be retrospectively classified as a neurologist , but the field did not exist in his time .   During 1873 Tourette began medical studies at Poitiers . He later relocated to Paris where he became a student , amanuensis , and house physician of his mentor , the influential contemporary neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot , director of the Salpêtrière Hospital . Charcot also helped him to advance in his academic career . Tourette studied and lectured in psychotherapy , hysteria and medical and legal ramifications of mesmerism ( modern-day hypnosis ) .   Tourette described the symptoms of Tourette 's syndrome in nine patients in 1884 , using the name `` maladie des tics '' . Charcot renamed the syndrome `` Gilles de la Tourette 's illness '' in his honor .   In 1893 , a former female patient shot Tourette in the head , claiming he had hypnotized her against her will . Both Tourette and many modern hypnologists state that this is impossible . His mentor , Charcot , had died recently , and his young son had also died recently . After these events , Tourette began to experience mood swings between depression and hypomania . Nevertheless , he organized public lectures in which he spoke about literacy , mesmerism and theatre .   Tourette published an article on hysteria in the German Army , which angered Bismarck , and a further article about unhygienic conditions in the floating hospitals on the river Thames . With Gabriel Legué he analyzed abbess Jeanne des Anges ' account of her hysteria that was allegedly based on her unrequited love for a priest Urbain Grandier , who was later burned for witchcraft .   Around 1902 , Tourette 's condition worsened and he was dismissed from his post .

She was the mother of King Henry VIII . Therefore , she was the daughter , sister , niece , wife , mother and grandmother of successive Kings of England .   The period of Henry VI 's readaption from October 1470 until April 1471 and the period between her father 's death in 1483 , when she was 17 , and the making of peace between her mother and her uncle Richard were violent and anxious interludes in what was mostly a peaceful life .

One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines , the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves .   Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines , perhaps the oldest through its inclusion of astronomy . Over the last two millennia , physics was a part of natural philosophy along with chemistry , biology , and certain branches of mathematics , but during the scientific revolution in the 17th century , the natural sciences emerged as unique research programs in their own right . Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research , such as biophysics and quantum chemistry , and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined . New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms of other sciences while opening new avenues of research in areas such as mathematics and philosophy .   Physics also makes significant contributions through advances in new technologies that arise from theoretical breakthroughs . For example , advances in the understanding of electromagnetism or nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products that have dramatically transformed modern-day society , such as television , computers , domestic appliances , and nuclear weapons ; advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization , and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus .

87383,George III of the United Kingdom did not experience the defeat of France.,George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom,"George III ( George William Frederick ; 4 June 1738 -- 29 January 1820 ) was King of Great Britain and Ireland from 25 October 1760 until the union of the two countries on 1 January 1801 , after which he was King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland until his death . He was concurrently Duke and prince-elector of Brunswick-Lüneburg ( `` Hanover '' ) in the Holy Roman Empire until his promotion to King of Hanover on 12 October 1814 . He was the third British monarch of the House of Hanover , but unlike his two predecessors he was born in Britain , spoke English as his first language , and never visited Hanover .   His life and with it his reign , which were longer than any other British monarch before him , were marked by a series of military conflicts involving his kingdoms , much of the rest of Europe , and places farther afield in Africa , the Americas and Asia . Early in his reign , Great Britain defeated France in the Seven Years ' War , becoming the dominant European power in North America and India . However , many of Britain 's American colonies were soon lost in the American War of Independence . Further wars against revolutionary and Napoleonic France from 1793 concluded in the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 .   In the later part of his life , George III had recurrent , and eventually permanent , mental illness . Although it has since been suggested that he had the blood disease porphyria , the cause of his illness remains unknown . After a final relapse in 1810 , a regency was established , and George III 's eldest son , George , Prince of Wales , ruled as Prince Regent . On George III 's death , the Prince Regent succeeded his father as George IV .   Historical analysis of George III 's life has gone through a `` kaleidoscope of changing views '' that have depended heavily on the prejudices of his biographers and the sources available to them . Until it was reassessed in the second half of the 20th century , his reputation in the United States was one of a tyrant ; and in Britain he became `` the scapegoat for the failure of imperialism '' .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

PBS is funded by member station dues , the Corporation for Public Broadcasting , government agencies , corporations , foundations and individual citizens . All proposed funding is subjected to a set of standards to ensure the program is free of influence from the funding source .   Since the mid-2000s , Roper polls commissioned by PBS have consistently placed the service as the most-trusted national institution in the United States . However , PBS is not responsible for all programming carried on public television stations , a large proportion of which ( including most specials aired during pledge drives ) come from affiliates , including such member stations as WGBH , WETA-TV , WNET , WTTW National Productions ) , American Public Television and independent producers . This arbitrary distinction is a frequent source of viewer confusion .   The service has more than 350 member television stations , many owned by educational institutions or non-profit groups affiliated with a local public school district , collegiate educational institution or by state government-owned or - related entities . It also operates National Datacast ( NDI ) , a subsidiary which offers datacasting services via member stations , and provides additional revenue for PBS and its member stations .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ
94383,Elizabeth of York had a father.,Elizabeth_of_York,"Elizabeth of York ( 11 February 1466 -- 11 February 1503 ) was queen consort of England from 1486 until her death . As the wife of Henry VII , she was the first Tudor queen . She was the daughter of Edward IV and niece of Richard III , and she married the king following Henry 's victory at the Battle of Bosworth which started the last phase of the Wars of the Roses . She was the mother of King Henry VIII . Therefore , she was the daughter , sister , niece , wife , mother and grandmother of successive Kings of England .   The period of Henry VI 's readaption from October 1470 until April 1471 and the period between her father 's death in 1483 , when she was 17 , and the making of peace between her mother and her uncle Richard were violent and anxious interludes in what was mostly a peaceful life . Her two brothers disappeared , the `` Princes in the Tower '' , their fate unknown . She was welcomed back to court by her Uncle Richard III , along with all of her sisters . As a Yorkist princess , the final victory of the Lancastrian faction in the War of the Roses may have seemed a further disaster , but Henry Tudor knew the importance of Yorkist support for his invasion and promised to marry her before he arrived in England ; this was an important move , which , however , failed to bring him the desired Yorkist support .   Her marriage seems to have been successful , though her eldest son Arthur , Prince of Wales , died at age 15 in 1502 , and three other children died young . She seems to have played little part in politics . Her surviving children became a King of England and queens of France and Scotland ; it is through the Scottish Stuart dynasty that her many modern royal descendants trace their descent from her .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

76522,The American Civil War was fought between the East and the South.,American_Civil_War,"The American Civil War was fought in the United States from 1861 to 1865 . After a long standing controversy over slavery and state 's rights , war broke out in April 1861 , when Confederates attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina , shortly after Abraham Lincoln was elected . The nationalists of the Union proclaimed loyalty to the U.S. Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States of America advocating states ' rights to perpetual slavery and its expansion in the Americas .   Among the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states individually declared their secession from the U.S. to form the Confederate States of America . The Confederacy grew to include eleven states ; it claimed two more border states ( Kentucky and Missouri ) , the Indian Territory , and the southern portions of the Union 's western territories of Arizona and New Mexico , which was organized and incorporated into the Confederacy as Confederate Arizona . The Confederacy was never diplomatically recognized by the United States government , nor was it recognized by any foreign country ( although Britain and France granted it belligerent status ) . The states that remained loyal , including the border states where slavery was legal , were known as the Union or the North .   The North and South quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over four years . During this time many innovations in warfare occurred , including the development and use of iron-clad ships , ultimately changing naval strategy around the world . The Union finally won the war when General Robert E. Lee surrendered to General Ulysses S. Grant at the battle of Appomattox , which triggered a series of surrenders by Confederate generals throughout the southern states . Four years of intense combat left 620,000 to 750,000 soldiers dead , a higher number than the number of American military deaths in World War I and World War II combined , and much of the South 's infrastructure was destroyed . The Confederacy collapsed , slavery was abolished and 4 million slaves were freed . The Reconstruction Era ( 1863 -- 1877 ) overlapped and followed the war , with the process of restoring national unity , strengthening the national government , and granting civil rights to freed slaves throughout the country . The Civil War is arguably the most studied and written about episode in American history .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

The series chronicles the adventures and endeavors of the title character and his various friends in the fictional underwater city of Bikini Bottom . The series ' popularity has made it a media franchise , as well as the highest rated series to ever air on Nickelodeon , and the most distributed property of MTV Networks . As of 2015 , the media franchise has generated $ 12 billion in merchandising revenue for Nickelodeon .   Many of the ideas for the series originated in an unpublished educational comic book titled The Intertidal Zone , which Hillenburg created in 1989 . He began developing SpongeBob SquarePants into a television series in 1996 upon the cancellation of Rocko 's Modern Life , and turned to Tom Kenny , who had worked with him on that series , to voice the title character . SpongeBob was originally going to be named SpongeBoy , and the series was to be called SpongeBoy Ahoy ! , but these were both changed , as the name was already trademarked .   Nickelodeon held a preview for the series in the United States on May 1 , 1999 , following the television airing of the 1999 Kids ' Choice Awards . The series officially premiered on July 17 , 1999 . It has received worldwide critical acclaim since its premiere and gained enormous popularity by its second season . A feature film , The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie , was released in theaters on November 19 , 2004 , and a sequel was released on February 6 , 2015 .

The series has won a variety of awards , including six Annie Awards , eight Golden Reel Awards , two Emmy Awards , 12 Kids ' Choice Awards , and two BAFTA Children 's Awards . Despite its widespread popularity , the series has been involved in several public controversies , including one centered on speculation over SpongeBob 's intended sexual orientation , and another focusing on the perceived declining quality of the show 's content since the release of the first film . In 2011 , a newly described species of fungi , Spongiforma squarepantsii , was named after the cartoon 's title character .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Henry 's marriage to her , and her subsequent execution by beheading , made her a key figure in the political and religious upheaval that was the start of the English Reformation . Her daughter Elizabeth would later succeed Henry VIII as Elizabeth I , Queen of England and Ireland .   Anne was the daughter of Thomas Boleyn , 1st Earl of Wiltshire , and his wife , Lady Elizabeth Howard , and was educated in the Netherlands and France , largely as a maid of honour to Claude of France .   Anne returned to England in early 1522 , to marry her Irish cousin James Butler , 9th Earl of Ormond ; the marriage plans were broken up by Cardinal Wolsey , and instead she secured a post at court as maid of honour to Henry VIII 's wife , Catherine of Aragon .   Early in 1523 Anne was secretly betrothed to Henry Percy , son of the 5th Earl of Northumberland , but the betrothal was broken by Cardinal Wolsey in January 1524 and Anne was sent back home to Hever Castle . In February/March 1526 , Henry VIII began his pursuit of Anne . She resisted his attempts to seduce her , refusing to become his mistress -- which her sister Mary had been . It soon became the one absorbing object of Henry 's desires to annul his marriage to Queen Catherine so he would be free to marry Anne . When it became clear that Pope Clement VII would not annul the marriage , the breaking of the power of the Catholic Church in England began . In 1532 , Henry granted Anne the Marquessate of Pembroke .   Henry and Anne married on 25 January 1533 , after a secret marriage on 14 November 1532 . On 23 May 1533 , newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer declared Henry and Catherine 's marriage null and void ; five days later , he declared Henry and Anne 's marriage valid . Shortly afterwards , the Pope decreed sentences of excommunication against Henry and Cranmer . As a result of this marriage and these excommunications , the first break between the Church of England and Rome took place and the Church of England was brought under the King 's control . Anne was crowned Queen of England on 1 June 1533 . On 7 September , she gave birth to the future Queen Elizabeth I. Henry was disappointed to have a daughter rather than a son but hoped a son would follow and professed to love Elizabeth . Anne subsequently had three miscarriages , and by March 1536 , Henry was courting Jane Seymour . In order to marry Jane Seymour , Henry had to find reasons for his marriage with Anne to end .   Henry had Anne investigated for high treason in April 1536 . On 2 May she was arrested and sent to the Tower of London , where she was tried before a jury of peers -- which included Henry Percy , her former betrothed , and her own uncle , Thomas Howard -- and found guilty on 15 May . She was beheaded four days later . Modern historians view the charges against her , which included adultery , incest , and plotting to kill the king , as unconvincing . Some say that Anne was accused of witchcraft but the indictments make no mention of this charge .   After the coronation of her daughter , Elizabeth , as queen , Anne was venerated as a martyr and heroine of the English Reformation , particularly through the works of John Foxe . Over the centuries , she has inspired , or been mentioned , in many artistic and cultural works and thereby retained her hold on the popular imagination . She has been called `` the most influential and important queen consort England has ever had '' , for she provided the occasion for Henry VIII to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon and declare his independence from the Holy See .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu was formed from Kodokan judo ground fighting ( newaza ) fundamentals that were taught by a number of individuals including Takeo Yano , Mitsuyo Maeda and Soshihiro Satake . Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu eventually came to be its own art through the experiments , practices , and adaptation of judo through Carlos and Helio Gracie ( who passed their knowledge on to their extended family ) as well as other instructors who were students of Maeda , such as Luiz Franca .   BJJ promotes the concept that a smaller , weaker person can successfully defend against a bigger , stronger , heavier assailant by using proper technique , leverage , and most notably , taking the fight to the ground , and then applying joint-locks and chokeholds to defeat the opponent . BJJ training can be used for sport grappling tournaments and in self-defense situations . Sparring ( commonly referred to as rolling ) and live drilling play a major role in training , and a premium is placed on performance , especially in competition , in relation to progress and ascension through its ranking system .   Since its inception in 1882 , its parent art of judo was separated from older systems of Japanese jujutsu by an important difference that was passed on to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu : it is not solely a martial art , but it is also a sport ; a method for promoting physical fitness and building character in young people ; and , ultimately , a way ( Do ) of life .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

124986,Scandinavia does not include territory.,Scandinavia,"Scandinavia -LSB- ˌskændɪˈneɪviə -RSB- is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages .   The term Scandinavia always includes the three kingdoms of Denmark , Norway , and Sweden . The remote Norwegian islands of Svalbard and Jan Mayen are usually not seen as a part of Scandinavia , nor is Greenland , an overseas territory of Denmark . However , the Faroe Islands , also a Danish overseas territory , are sometimes included , as sometimes are Iceland , Finland , and the Finnish autonomous region of the Åland Islands , because of their historical association with the Scandinavian countries and the Scandinavian peoples and languages . This looser definition almost equates to that of the Nordic countries . In Nordic languages , only Denmark , Norway and Sweden are commonly included in the definition of Scandinavia .   In English usage , Scandinavia sometimes refers to the geographical area , also known as the Scandinavian Peninsula . The name Scandinavia originally referred vaguely to the formerly Danish , now Swedish , region Scania . The terms Scandinavia and Scandinavian entered usage in the late 18th century as terms for Denmark , Norway and Sweden , their Germanic majority peoples and associated language and culture , the term being introduced by the early linguistic and cultural Scandinavist movement .   The majority of the population of Scandinavia are descended from several ( North ) Germanic tribes who originally inhabited the southern part of Scandinavia and spoke a Germanic language that evolved into Old Norse . Icelanders and the Faroese are to a significant extent descended from the Norse , and are therefore often seen as Scandinavian . Finland is mainly populated by Finns , with a minority of approximately 5 % of Swedish speakers . A small minority of Sami people live in the extreme north of Scandinavia .   The Danish , Norwegian and Swedish languages form a dialect continuum and are known as the Scandinavian languages -- all of which are considered mutually intelligible with one another . Faroese and Icelandic , sometimes referred to as insular Scandinavian languages , are intelligible in continental Scandinavian languages only to a limited extent . Finnish and Meänkieli are closely related to each other and more distantly to the Sami languages , but are entirely unrelated to the Scandinavian languages . Apart from these , German , Yiddish and Romani are recognized minority languages in Scandinavia .   The southern and by far most populous regions of Scandinavia have a temperate climate . Scandinavia extends north of the Arctic Circle , but has relatively mild weather for its latitude due to the Gulf Stream . Much of the Scandinavian mountains have an alpine tundra climate . There are many lakes and moraines , legacies of the last glacial period , which ended about ten millennia ago .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

67417,A President of the United States was the person who delivered the Gettysburg Address.,Gettysburg_Address,"The Gettysburg Address is a speech by U.S. President Abraham Lincoln , one of the best-known in American history . It was delivered by Lincoln during the American Civil War , on the afternoon of Thursday , November 19 , 1863 , at the dedication of the Soldiers ' National Cemetery in Gettysburg , Pennsylvania , four and a half months after the Union armies defeated those of the Confederacy at the Battle of Gettysburg .   Abraham Lincoln 's carefully crafted address , secondary to other presentations that day , was one of the greatest and most influential statements of national purpose . In just over two minutes , Lincoln reiterated the principles of human equality espoused by the Declaration of Independence and proclaimed the Civil War as a struggle for the preservation of the Union sundered by the secession crisis , with `` a new birth of freedom '' that would bring true equality to all of its citizens . Lincoln also redefined the Civil War as a struggle not just for the Union , but also for the principle of human equality .   Beginning with the now-iconic phrase `` Four score and seven years ago '' -- referring to the United States Declaration of Independence in 1776 -- Lincoln examined the founding principles of the United States as stated in the Declaration of Independence . In the context of the Civil War , Lincoln also memorialized the sacrifices of those who gave their lives at Gettysburg and extolled virtues for the listeners ( and the nation ) to ensure the survival of America 's representative democracy : that `` government of the people , by the people , for the people , shall not perish from the earth . ''   Despite the speech 's prominent place in the history and popular culture of the United States , the exact wording and location of the speech are disputed . The five known manuscripts of the Gettysburg Address in Lincoln 's hand differ in a number of details , and also differ from contemporary newspaper reprints of the speech . Modern scholarship locates the speakers ' platform 40 yards ( or more ) away from the Traditional Site within Soldiers ' National Cemetery at the Soldiers ' National Monument and entirely within private , adjacent Evergreen Cemetery .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Located in the Pacific Ocean , it lies off the eastern coast of the Asian mainland , and stretches from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Taiwan in the southwest .   The kanji that make up Japan 's name mean `` sun origin '' . 日 can be read as ni and means sun , while 本 can be read as hon , or pon and means origin . Japan is often referred to by the famous epithet `` Land of the Rising Sun '' in reference to its Japanese name .   Japan is a stratovolcanic archipelago consisting of about 6,852 islands . The four largest are Honshu , Hokkaido , Kyushu and Shikoku , which make up about ninety-seven percent of Japan 's land area and often are referred to as home islands . The country is divided into 47 prefectures in eight regions ; Hokkaido being the northernmost prefecture and Okinawa being the southernmost one . The population of 127 million is the world 's tenth largest . Japanese people make up 98.5 % of Japan 's total population . Approximately 9.1 million people live in the city of Tokyo , the capital of Japan .   Archaeological research indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period . The first written mention of Japan is in Chinese history texts from the 1st century AD . Influence from other regions , mainly China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , has characterized Japan 's history . From the 12th century until 1868 , Japan was ruled by successive feudal military shoguns who ruled in the name of the Emperor .   Japan entered into a long period of isolation in the early 17th century , which was ended in 1853 when a United States fleet pressured Japan to open to the West . After nearly two decades of internal conflict and insurrection , the Imperial Court regained its political power in 1868 through the help of several clans from Chōshū and Satsuma , and the Empire of Japan was established . In the late 19th and early 20th centuries , victories in the First Sino-Japanese War , the Russo-Japanese War and World War I allowed Japan to expand its empire during a period of increasing militarism .   The Second Sino-Japanese War of 1937 expanded into part of World War II in 1941 , which came to an end in 1945 following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Japanese surrender . Since adopting its revised constitution on May 3 , 1947 during the occupation by the SCAP , Japan has maintained a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy with an Emperor and an elected legislature called the National Diet .   Japan is a member of the UN , the OECD , the G7 , the G8 , and the G20 and is considered a great power . The country has the world 's third-largest economy by nominal GDP and the world 's fourth-largest economy by purchasing power parity .

78831,Woodrow Wilson lived in a section of the 1900s.,World_War_I,"World War I ( WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War , the Great War , or the War to End All Wars , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . More than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history . Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war ( including the victims of a number of genocides ) , a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents ' technological and industrial sophistication , and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare . It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history , and paved the way for major political changes , including revolutions in many of the nations involved and to WWII twenty-one years later .   The war drew in all the world 's economic great powers , assembled in two opposing alliances : the Allies ( based on the Triple Entente of the Russian Empire , the French Third Republic , and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ) versus the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary . Although Italy was a member of the Triple Alliance alongside Germany and Austria-Hungary , it did not join the Central Powers , as Austria-Hungary had taken the offensive against the terms of the alliance . These alliances were reorganised and expanded as more nations entered the war : Italy , Japan and the United States joined the Allies , while the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria joined the Central Powers .   The trigger for the war was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria , heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary , by Yugoslav nationalist Gavrilo Princip in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914 . This set off a diplomatic crisis when Austria-Hungary delivered an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia , and entangled international alliances formed over the previous decades were invoked . Within weeks , the major powers were at war and the conflict soon spread around the world .   On 25 July Russia began mobilisation and on 28 July , the Austro-Hungarians declared war on Serbia . Germany presented an ultimatum to Russia to demobilise , and when this was refused , declared war on Russia on 1 August . Being outnumbered on the eastern front , Russia urged its Triple Entente ally France to open up a second front in the west . Back in 1870 , the Franco-Prussian war had ended the Second French Empire and ceded the provinces of Alsace-Lorraine to a unified Germany . Bitterness over their defeat and the determinance to retake Alsace-Lorraine made the acceptance of Russia 's plea for help an easy choice so France began full mobilisation on 1 August and on 3 August , Germany declared war on France . The border between France and Germany was heavily fortified on both sides so according to the Schlieffen Plan , Germany then invaded neutral Belgium and Luxembourg before moving towards France from the north , leading the United Kingdom to declare war on Germany on 4 August due to their violation of Belgian neutrality . After the German march on Paris was halted in the Battle of the Marne , what became known as the Western Front settled into a battle of attrition , with a trench line that changed little until 1917 . On the Eastern Front , the Russian army led a successful campaign against the Austro-Hungarians , but the Germans stopped its invasion of East Prussia in the battles of Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes . In November 1914 , the Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers , opening fronts in the Caucasus , Mesopotamia and the Sinai . In 1915 , Italy joined the Allies and Bulgaria joined the Central Powers ; Romania joined the Allies in 1916 , as did the United States in 1917 .   The Russian government collapsed in March 1917 , and a revolution in November followed by a further military defeat brought the Russians to terms with the Central Powers via the Treaty of Brest Litovsk , which granted the Germans a significant victory . After a stunning German offensive along the Western Front in the spring of 1918 , the Allies rallied and drove back the Germans in a series of successful offensives . On 4 November 1918 , the Austro-Hungarian empire agreed to an armistice , and Germany , which had its own trouble with revolutionaries , agreed to an armistice on 11 November 1918 , ending the war in victory for the Allies .   By the end of the war or soon after , the German Empire , Russian Empire , Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire ceased to exist . National borders were redrawn , with several independent nations restored or created , and Germany 's colonies were parceled out among the victors . During the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 , the Big Four ( Britain , France , the United States and Italy ) imposed their terms in a series of treaties . The League of Nations was formed with the aim of preventing any repetition of such a conflict . This effort failed , and economic depression , renewed nationalism , weakened successor states , and feelings of humiliation ( particularly in Germany ) eventually contributed to the start of World War II .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Revolver was the last Beatles album to be subjected to Capitol 's policy of altering the band 's intended running order and content .   The Beatles recorded the album following a three-month break from professional commitments at the start of 1966 , and during a period when London was feted as the era 's cultural capital . The songs reflect the influence of psychedelic drugs such as LSD and the increasing sophistication of the Beatles ' lyrics to address themes including death and transcendence from material concerns . With no thoughts of reproducing their new material in concert , the band made liberal use of studio techniques such as varispeeding , reversed tapes , close audio miking and automatic double tracking ( ADT ) , in addition to employing musical instrumentation outside of their standard live set-up . Some of the changes in studio practice introduced by Revolver , particularly ADT , were soon adopted throughout the recording industry . The sessions also produced a non-album single , `` Paperback Writer '' backed with `` Rain '' , for which the Beatles filmed their first on-location promotional films .   In the UK , Revolver fourteen tracks were released to radio stations throughout July 1966 , with the music signifying what author Ian MacDonald later described as `` a second pop revolution -- one which while galvanising their existing rivals and inspiring many new ones , left all of them far behind '' . The album 's US release coincided with the Beatles ' final concert tour , which was marred by the controversy surrounding John Lennon 's remark that the band had become `` more popular than Jesus '' . The record topped the UK Albums Chart for seven weeks and America 's Billboard Top LPs list for six weeks . Together with the children 's novelty song `` Yellow Submarine '' , `` Eleanor Rigby '' became an international hit when issued as a double A-side single .   Revolvers cover artwork , designed by Klaus Voormann , won the 1967 Grammy Award for Best Album Cover , Graphic Arts . The album was influential in advancing principles espoused by the 1960s counterculture and in inspiring the development of pop music into subgenres such as psychedelic rock , electronica , progressive rock and world music . With the restoration of the three omitted tracks for its international CD release in 1987 , many music critics recognise Revolver as the Beatles ' best album , surpassing Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band . The album was ranked first in Colin Larkin 's book All-Time Top 1000 Albums and third in Rolling Stone magazine 's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time . In 2013 , after the British Phonographic Industry had changed its sales award rules , Revolver was certified platinum in the UK . The album has been certified 5 × platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

She is identified with the planet Venus ; her Roman equivalent is the goddess -LSB- Venus ( mythology ) , Venus -RSB- . Myrtle , roses , doves , sparrows and swans were sacred to her .   In Hesiod 's Theogony , Aphrodite was created from the sea foam ( aphros ) produced by Uranus 's genitals , which had been severed by Cronus .  In Homer 's Iliad , however , she is the daughter of Zeus and Dione . In Plato ( Symposium , 180e ) , these two origins are said to be of hitherto separate entities : Aphrodite Ourania ( a transcendent , `` Heavenly '' Aphrodite ) and Aphrodite Pandemos ( Aphrodite common to `` all the people '' ) . She had many other names , each emphasising a different aspect of the same goddess , or used by a different local cult . Thus she was also known as Cytherea ( Lady of Cythera ) and Cypris ( Lady of Cyprus ) , both of which claimed to be her place of birth .   In Greek myth , the other gods feared that Aphrodite 's beauty might lead to conflict and war , through rivalry for her favours ; so Zeus married her off to Hephaestus . Despite this , Aphrodite followed her own inclinations , and had many lovers -- both gods , such as Ares , and men , such as Anchises . She played a role in the Eros and Psyche legend , and was both lover and surrogate mother of Adonis . Many lesser beings were said to be children of Aphrodite .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ
143009,The American Civil War took place in Canada.,American_Civil_War,"The American Civil War was fought in the United States from 1861 to 1865 . After a long standing controversy over slavery and state 's rights , war broke out in April 1861 , when Confederates attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina , shortly after Abraham Lincoln was elected . The nationalists of the Union proclaimed loyalty to the U.S. Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States of America advocating states ' rights to perpetual slavery and its expansion in the Americas .   Among the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states individually declared their secession from the U.S. to form the Confederate States of America . The Confederacy grew to include eleven states ; it claimed two more border states ( Kentucky and Missouri ) , the Indian Territory , and the southern portions of the Union 's western territories of Arizona and New Mexico , which was organized and incorporated into the Confederacy as Confederate Arizona . The Confederacy was never diplomatically recognized by the United States government , nor was it recognized by any foreign country ( although Britain and France granted it belligerent status ) . The states that remained loyal , including the border states where slavery was legal , were known as the Union or the North .   The North and South quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over four years . During this time many innovations in warfare occurred , including the development and use of iron-clad ships , ultimately changing naval strategy around the world . The Union finally won the war when General Robert E. Lee surrendered to General Ulysses S. Grant at the battle of Appomattox , which triggered a series of surrenders by Confederate generals throughout the southern states . Four years of intense combat left 620,000 to 750,000 soldiers dead , a higher number than the number of American military deaths in World War I and World War II combined , and much of the South 's infrastructure was destroyed . The Confederacy collapsed , slavery was abolished and 4 million slaves were freed . The Reconstruction Era ( 1863 -- 1877 ) overlapped and followed the war , with the process of restoring national unity , strengthening the national government , and granting civil rights to freed slaves throughout the country . The Civil War is arguably the most studied and written about episode in American history .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

128370,Pattern recognition is used strictly on known patterns.,Pattern_recognition,"Pattern recognition is a branch of machine learning that focuses on the recognition of patterns and regularities in data , although it is in some cases considered to be nearly synonymous with machine learning . Pattern recognition systems are in many cases trained from labeled `` training '' data ( supervised learning ) , but when no labeled data are available other algorithms can be used to discover previously unknown patterns ( unsupervised learning ) .   The terms pattern recognition , machine learning , data mining and knowledge discovery in databases ( KDD ) are hard to separate , as they largely overlap in their scope . Machine learning is the common term for supervised learning methods and originates from artificial intelligence , whereas KDD and data mining have a larger focus on unsupervised methods and stronger connection to business use . Pattern recognition has its origins in engineering , and the term is popular in the context of computer vision : a leading computer vision conference is named Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition . In pattern recognition , there may be a higher interest to formalize , explain and visualize the pattern , while machine learning traditionally focuses on maximizing the recognition rates . Yet , all of these domains have evolved substantially from their roots in artificial intelligence , engineering and statistics , and they 've become increasingly similar by integrating developments and ideas from each other .   In machine learning , pattern recognition is the assignment of a label to a given input value . In statistics , discriminant analysis was introduced for this same purpose in 1936 . An example of pattern recognition is classification , which attempts to assign each input value to one of a given set of classes ( for example , determine whether a given email is `` spam '' or `` non-spam '' ) . However , pattern recognition is a more general problem that encompasses other types of output as well . Other examples are regression , which assigns a real-valued output to each input ; sequence labeling , which assigns a class to each member of a sequence of values ( for example , part of speech tagging , which assigns a part of speech to each word in an input sentence ) ; and parsing , which assigns a parse tree to an input sentence , describing the syntactic structure of the sentence .   Pattern recognition algorithms generally aim to provide a reasonable answer for all possible inputs and to perform `` most likely '' matching of the inputs , taking into account their statistical variation . This is opposed to pattern matching algorithms , which look for exact matches in the input with pre-existing patterns . A common example of a pattern-matching algorithm is regular expression matching , which looks for patterns of a given sort in textual data and is included in the search capabilities of many text editors and word processors . In contrast to pattern recognition , pattern matching is generally not considered a type of machine learning , although pattern-matching algorithms ( especially with fairly general , carefully tailored patterns ) can sometimes succeed in providing similar-quality output of the sort provided by pattern-recognition algorithms .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

It was the flagship product of the Netscape Communications Corp and was the dominant web browser in terms of usage share in the 1990s , but by 2002 its usage had almost disappeared . This was primarily due to the increased usage of Microsoft 's Internet Explorer web browser software , and partly because the Netscape Corporation ( later purchased by AOL ) did not sustain Netscape Navigator 's technical innovation after the late 1990s .   The business demise of Netscape was a central premise of Microsoft 's antitrust trial , wherein the Court ruled that Microsoft Corporation 's bundling of Internet Explorer with the Windows operating system was a monopolistic and illegal business practice . The decision came too late for Netscape , however , as Internet Explorer had by then become the dominant web browser in Windows .   The Netscape Navigator web browser was succeeded by the Netscape Communicator suite in 1997 . Netscape Communicator 's 4.x source code was the base for the Netscape-developed Mozilla Application Suite , which was later renamed SeaMonkey .

The Serbian royal House of Karađorđević became the Yugoslav royal dynasty . Yugoslavia gained international recognition on 13 July 1922 at the Conference of Ambassadors in Paris .

Yugoslavia was renamed the Federal People 's Republic of Yugoslavia in 1946 , when a communist government was established . It acquired the territories of Istria , Rijeka , and Zadar from Italy . Partisan leader Josip Broz Tito ruled the country as president until his death in 1980 . In 1963 , the country was renamed again as the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( SFRY ) .   The constituent six socialist republics that made up the country were the SR Bosnia and Herzegovina , SR Croatia , SR Macedonia , SR Montenegro , SR Serbia , and SR Slovenia . Serbia contained two Socialist Autonomous Provinces , Vojvodina and Kosovo , which after 1974 were largely equal to the other members of the federation . After an economic and political crisis in the 1980s and the rise of nationalism , Yugoslavia broke up along its republics ' borders , at first into five countries , leading to the Yugoslav Wars .   After the breakup , the republics of Serbia and Montenegro formed a reduced federation , the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( FRY ) , which aspired to the status of sole legal successor to the SFRY , but those claims were opposed by the other former republics . Eventually , Serbia and Montenegro accepted the opinion of the Badinter Arbitration Committee about shared succession . Serbia and Montenegro themselves broke up in 2006 and became independent states , while Kosovo proclaimed independence in 2008 .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

37710,Mercedes-Benz is a vehicle manufacturer.,Car,"A car ( or automobile ) is a wheeled , self-powered motor vehicle used for transportation and a product of the automotive industry . Most definitions of the term specify that cars are designed to run primarily on roads , to have seating for one to eight people , to typically have four wheels with tyres , and to be constructed principally for the transport of people rather than goods . The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car . In that year , German inventor Karl Benz built the Benz Patent-Motorwagen . Cars did not become widely available until the early 20th century . One of the first cars that was accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T , an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company . Cars were rapidly adopted in the United States of America , where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts , but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world .   Cars are equipped with controls used for driving , parking , passenger comfort and safety , and controlling a variety of lights . Over the decades , additional features and controls have been added to vehicles , making them progressively more complex . Examples include rear reversing cameras , air conditioning , navigation systems , and in car entertainment . Most cars in use in the 2010s are propelled by an internal combustion engine , fueled by deflagration of gasoline ( also known as petrol ) or diesel . Both fuels cause air pollution and are also blamed for contributing to climate change and global warming . Vehicles using alternative fuels such as ethanol flexible-fuel vehicles and natural gas vehicles are also gaining popularity in some countries . Electric cars , which were invented early in the history of the car , began to become commercially available in 2008 .   There are costs and benefits to car use . The costs of car usage include the cost of : acquiring the vehicle , interest payments ( if the car is financed ) , repairs and auto maintenance , fuel , depreciation , driving time , parking fees , taxes , and insurance . The costs to society of car use include : maintaining roads , land use , road congestion , air pollution , public health , health care , and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life . Road traffic accidents are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide .   The benefits may include on-demand transportation , mobility , independence , and convenience . The societal benefits may include : economic benefits , such as job and wealth creation from car production , sales and maintenance , transportation provision , society well-being derived from leisure and travel opportunities , and revenue generation from the tax opportunities . The ability for humans to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies . It was estimated in 2014 that the number of cars had risen to over 1.25 billion vehicles , up from the 500 million of 1986 . The numbers are increasing rapidly , especially in China , India and other newly industrialized countries .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

It is related to , but not the same as , invention . Innovation is often manifested via the engineering process . The opposite of innovation is exnovation .   While a novel device is often described as an innovation , in economics , management science , and other fields of practice and analysis , innovation is generally considered to be the result of a process that brings together various novel ideas in a way that they affect society .

148642,Therasia is in the volcanic island group of Visayas.,Santorini,"Santorini ( Σαντορίνη , pronounced -LSB- sandoˈrini -RSB- ) , classically Thera ( English pronunciation -LSB- ˈθɪərə -RSB- ) , and officially Thira ( Greek : Θήρα -LSB- ˈθira -RSB- ) , is an island in the southern Aegean Sea , about 200 km southeast of Greece 's mainland . It is the largest island of a small , circular archipelago which bears the same name and is the remnant of a volcanic caldera . It forms the southernmost member of the Cyclades group of islands , with an area of approximately 73 km2 and a 2011 census population of 15,550 . The municipality of Santorini includes the inhabited islands of Santorini and Therasia and the uninhabited islands of Nea Kameni , Palaia Kameni , Aspronisi , and Christiana . The total land area is 90.623 km2 . Santorini is part of the Thira regional unit .   Santorini is essentially what remains after an enormous volcanic eruption that destroyed the earliest settlements on a formerly single island , and created the current geological caldera . A giant central , rectangular lagoon , which measures about 12 by , is surrounded by 300 m high , steep cliffs on three sides . The main island slopes downward to the Aegean Sea . On the fourth side , the lagoon is separated from the sea by another much smaller island called Therasia ; the lagoon is connected to the sea in two places , in the northwest and southwest . The depth of the caldera , at 400m , makes it impossible for any but the largest ships to anchor anywhere in the protected bay ; there is also a fisherman 's harbour at Vlychada , on the southwestern coast . The island 's principal port is Athinios . The capital , Fira , clings to the top of the cliff looking down on the lagoon . The volcanic rocks present from the prior eruptions feature olivine , and have a small presence of hornblende .   It is the most active volcanic centre in the South Aegean Volcanic Arc , though what remains today is chiefly a water-filled caldera . The volcanic arc is approximately 500 km long and 20 to wide . The region first became volcanically active around 3 -- 4 million years ago , though volcanism on Thera began around 2 million years ago with the extrusion of dacitic lavas from vents around the Akrotiri .   The island is the site of one of the largest volcanic eruptions in recorded history : the Minoan eruption ( sometimes called the Thera eruption ) , which occurred some 3,600 years ago at the height of the Minoan civilization . The eruption left a large caldera surrounded by volcanic ash deposits hundreds of metres deep and may have led indirectly to the collapse of the Minoan civilization on the island of Crete , 110 km to the south , through a gigantic tsunami . Another popular theory holds that the Thera eruption is the source of the legend of Atlantis .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ
218109,The Indian National Congress was founded only outside of India.,Indian_National_Congress,"The Indian National Congress ( INC , often called Congress ) is a broad-based political party in India . Founded in 1885 , the Congress led India to independence from Great Britain , and powerfully influenced other anti-colonial nationalist movements in the British Empire . After India 's independence in 1947 , the Congress formed the government at center in most instances , and also many regional state governments . The Congress is a secular , left-of-centre , party . Although it did not fare well in the last general elections in India in 2014 , it remains one of two major , nationwide , political parties in India , along with the right-wing , Hindu nationalist , Bhartiya Janata Party ( BJP ) .   The Congress was the first modern nationalist movement to emerge in the British Empire in Asia and Africa . It was founded in Bombay in late December 1885 , during the British Raj in India . Its principal founders were , Allan Octavian Hume ( a former administrator of Etawah district , North-Western Provinces , and pioneering ornithologist of India ) , as well as William Wedderburn , Pherozeshah Mehta , Dadabhai Naoroji , Dinshaw Wacha , and others . From the late 19th-century , and especially after 1920 , under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi , Congress became the principal leader of the Indian independence movement , with over 15 million members and over 70 million participants .   After independence in 1947 , Congress became India 's dominant political party ; , in the 15 general elections since independence , it has won an outright majority on six occasions and has led the ruling coalition a further four times , heading the central government for 49 years . There have been seven Congress Prime Ministers , the first being Jawaharlal Nehru ( 1947 -- 64 ) , and the most recent Manmohan Singh ( 2004 -- 14 ) . The party 's social liberal platform is generally considered to be on the centre-left of Indian politics .   From 2004 to 2014 , the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance , a coalition of several regional parties , formed the Indian government and was headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh . As of March 2017 , the party is in power in five states : Punjab , Himachal Pradesh , Karnataka , Meghalaya and Mizoram . In Bihar , it is a part of the ruling coalition . The Congress has previously directly ruled Andhra Pradesh , Tamil Nadu , Gujarat , Madhya Pradesh , Rajasthan , Uttar Pradesh and Goa . In the 2014 general election , the Congress had its poorest post-independence general election performance , winning only 44 seats of the 543-member house .   The Congress ' social policy is based upon the Gandhian principle of Sarvodaya -- the lifting up of all sections of society -- which involves the improvement of the lives of economically underprivileged and socially marginalised people . The party primarily endorses social liberalism -- seeking to balance individual liberty and social justice , and secularism -- asserting the right to be free from religious rule and teachings .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

He was concurrently Duke and prince-elector of Brunswick-Lüneburg ( `` Hanover '' ) in the Holy Roman Empire until his promotion to King of Hanover on 12 October 1814 . He was the third British monarch of the House of Hanover , but unlike his two predecessors he was born in Britain , spoke English as his first language , and never visited Hanover .   His life and with it his reign , which were longer than any other British monarch before him , were marked by a series of military conflicts involving his kingdoms , much of the rest of Europe , and places farther afield in Africa , the Americas and Asia . Early in his reign , Great Britain defeated France in the Seven Years ' War , becoming the dominant European power in North America and India . However , many of Britain 's American colonies were soon lost in the American War of Independence . Further wars against revolutionary and Napoleonic France from 1793 concluded in the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 .   In the later part of his life , George III had recurrent , and eventually permanent , mental illness . Although it has since been suggested that he had the blood disease porphyria , the cause of his illness remains unknown . After a final relapse in 1810 , a regency was established , and George III 's eldest son , George , Prince of Wales , ruled as Prince Regent . On George III 's death , the Prince Regent succeeded his father as George IV .   Historical analysis of George III 's life has gone through a `` kaleidoscope of changing views '' that have depended heavily on the prejudices of his biographers and the sources available to them . Until it was reassessed in the second half of the 20th century , his reputation in the United States was one of a tyrant ; and in Britain he became `` the scapegoat for the failure of imperialism '' .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Early in 1523 Anne was secretly betrothed to Henry Percy , son of the 5th Earl of Northumberland , but the betrothal was broken by Cardinal Wolsey in January 1524 and Anne was sent back home to Hever Castle . In February/March 1526 , Henry VIII began his pursuit of Anne . She resisted his attempts to seduce her , refusing to become his mistress -- which her sister Mary had been . It soon became the one absorbing object of Henry 's desires to annul his marriage to Queen Catherine so he would be free to marry Anne . When it became clear that Pope Clement VII would not annul the marriage , the breaking of the power of the Catholic Church in England began . In 1532 , Henry granted Anne the Marquessate of Pembroke .   Henry and Anne married on 25 January 1533 , after a secret marriage on 14 November 1532 . On 23 May 1533 , newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer declared Henry and Catherine 's marriage null and void ; five days later , he declared Henry and Anne 's marriage valid . Shortly afterwards , the Pope decreed sentences of excommunication against Henry and Cranmer . As a result of this marriage and these excommunications , the first break between the Church of England and Rome took place and the Church of England was brought under the King 's control . Anne was crowned Queen of England on 1 June 1533 . On 7 September , she gave birth to the future Queen Elizabeth I. Henry was disappointed to have a daughter rather than a son but hoped a son would follow and professed to love Elizabeth . Anne subsequently had three miscarriages , and by March 1536 , Henry was courting Jane Seymour . In order to marry Jane Seymour , Henry had to find reasons for his marriage with Anne to end .   Henry had Anne investigated for high treason in April 1536 . On 2 May she was arrested and sent to the Tower of London , where she was tried before a jury of peers -- which included Henry Percy , her former betrothed , and her own uncle , Thomas Howard -- and found guilty on 15 May . She was beheaded four days later . Modern historians view the charges against her , which included adultery , incest , and plotting to kill the king , as unconvincing . Some say that Anne was accused of witchcraft but the indictments make no mention of this charge .   After the coronation of her daughter , Elizabeth , as queen , Anne was venerated as a martyr and heroine of the English Reformation , particularly through the works of John Foxe . Over the centuries , she has inspired , or been mentioned , in many artistic and cultural works and thereby retained her hold on the popular imagination . She has been called `` the most influential and important queen consort England has ever had '' , for she provided the occasion for Henry VIII to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon and declare his independence from the Holy See .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

18066,Yin and yang show a balance between magnetized entities.,Yin_and_yang,"In Chinese philosophy , yin and yang ( also yin -- yang or yin yang , yīnyáng `` dark -- bright '' ) describe how seemingly opposite or contrary forces may actually be complementary , interconnected , and interdependent in the natural world , and how they may give rise to each other as they interrelate to one another . Many tangible dualities ( such as light and dark , fire and water , expanding and contracting ) are thought of as physical manifestations of the duality symbolized by yin and yang . This duality lies at the origins of many branches of classical Chinese science and philosophy , as well as being a primary guideline of traditional Chinese medicine , and a central principle of different forms of Chinese martial arts and exercise , such as baguazhang , taijiquan ( t ` ai chi ) , and qigong ( Chi Kung ) , as well as appearing in the pages of the I Ching .   Duality is found in many belief systems , but Yin and Yang are parts of a Oneness that is also equated with the Tao . A term has been coined dualistic-monism or dialectical monism . Yin and yang can be thought of as complementary ( rather than opposing ) forces that interact to form a dynamic system in which the whole is greater than the assembled parts . Everything has both yin and yang aspects ( for instance , shadow can not exist without light ) . Either of the two major aspects may manifest more strongly in a particular object , depending on the criterion of the observation . The yin yang ( i.e. taijitu symbol ) shows a balance between two opposites with a portion of the opposite element in each section .   In Taoist metaphysics , distinctions between good and bad , along with other dichotomous moral judgments , are perceptual , not real ; so , the duality of yin and yang is an indivisible whole . In the ethics of Confucianism on the other hand , most notably in the philosophy of Dong Zhongshu ( 2nd century BC ) , a moral dimension is attached to the idea of yin and yang .",Fact checking,BeIR/fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ
