1257_Samalas_eruption,0,"The 1257 Samalas eruption was a major volcanic eruption of the Samalas volcano , next to Mount Rinjani on the island of Lombok , Indonesia . It left a large caldera next to Rinjani volcano , the lake Segara Anak . This volcanic eruption reached a volcanic explosivity index of 7 , making it one of the largest eruptions of the Holocene . The occurrence of this eruption was originally deduced from ice core information revealing a spike in sulfate deposition around the year 1257 ; in 2013 the source of this eruption at Samalas was definitively proven as a result of historical records from that time . This eruption proceeded during four distinct phases , alternately creating eruption columns reaching up for tens of kilometres and pyroclastic flows that buried large parts of Lombok , destroying human habitations including the city of Pamatan . Ash from the eruption fell as far as Java . The volume of the deposits left exceeds 10 km3 .",Fact checking,BeIR/climate-fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

One carbon offset represents the reduction of one metric ton of carbon dioxide or its equivalent in other greenhouse gases . There are two markets for carbon offsets . In the larger , compliance market , companies , governments , or other entities buy carbon offsets in order to comply with caps on the total amount of carbon dioxide they are allowed to emit . This market exists in order to achieve compliance with obligations of Annex 1 Parties under the Kyoto Protocol , and of liable entities under the EU Emission Trading Scheme .",Fact checking,BeIR/climate-fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Climate change is already affecting agriculture , with effects unevenly distributed across the world . Future climate change will likely negatively affect crop production in low latitude countries , while effects in northern latitudes may be positive or negative . Climate change will probably increase the risk of food insecurity for some vulnerable groups , such as the poor .

Even if emissions are stabilized relatively soon , global warming and its effects will last many years , and adaptation will be necessary to the resulting changes in climate . Adaptation is especially important in developing countries since those countries are predicted to bear the brunt of the effects of global warming . That is , the capacity and potential for humans to adapt ( called adaptive capacity ) is unevenly distributed across different regions and populations , and developing countries generally have less capacity to adapt ( Schneider et al. , 2007 ) . Furthermore , the degree of adaptation correlates to the situational focus on environmental issues . Therefore , adaptation requires the situational assessment of sensitivity and vulnerability to environmental impacts . Adaptive capacity is closely linked to social and economic development ( IPCC , 2007 ) .

Correlation_does_not_imply_causation,0,"In statistics , many statistical tests calculate correlations between variables and when two variables are found to be correlated , it is tempting to assume that this shows that one variable causes the other . That `` correlation proves causation , '' is considered a questionable cause logical fallacy when two events occurring together are taken to have established a cause-and-effect relationship . This fallacy is also known as cum hoc ergo propter hoc , Latin for `` with this , therefore because of this , '' and `` false cause . '' A similar fallacy , that an event that followed another was necessarily a consequence of the first event , is the post hoc ergo propter hoc ( Latin for `` after this , therefore because of this . '' ) fallacy . For example , in a widely studied case , numerous epidemiological studies showed that women taking combined hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) also had a lower-than-average incidence of coronary heart disease ( CHD ) , leading doctors to propose that HRT was protective against CHD . But randomized controlled trials showed that HRT caused a small but statistically significant increase in risk of CHD .",Fact checking,BeIR/climate-fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

The use of HRT and decreased incidence of coronary heart disease were coincident effects of a common cause ( i.e. the benefits associated with a higher socioeconomic status ) , rather than a direct cause and effect , as had been supposed . As with any logical fallacy , identifying that the reasoning behind an argument is flawed does not imply that the resulting conclusion is false . In the instance above , if the trials had found that hormone replacement therapy does in fact have a negative incidence on the likelihood of coronary heart disease the assumption of causality would have been correct , although the logic behind the assumption would still have been flawed . Indeed , a few go further , using correlation as a basis for testing a hypothesis to try to establish a true causal relationship ; examples are the Granger causality test and convergent cross mapping .",Fact checking,BeIR/climate-fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ
Convection,0,"Convection is the movement of groups of molecules within fluids such as gases and liquids , including molten rock ( rheid ) . Convection takes place through advection , diffusion or both . Convection can not take place in most solids because neither bulk current flows nor significant diffusion of matter can take place . Diffusion of heat can take place in rigid solids , but that is called heat conduction . However , can take place in soft solids or mixtures where solid particles can move past each other . Thermal convection can be demonstrated by placing a heat source ( e.g. a Bunsen burner ) at the side of a glass full of a liquid , and observing the changes in temperature in the glass caused by the warmer ghost fluid circulating into cooler areas . Convective heat transfer is one of the major types of heat transfer , and convection is also a major mode of mass transfer in fluids .",Fact checking,BeIR/climate-fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ
Convection,1,"Convective heat and mass transfer take place both by diffusion -- the random Brownian motion of individual particles in the fluid -- and by advection , in which matter or heat is transported by the larger-scale motion of currents in the fluid . In the context of heat and mass transfer , the term `` convection '' is used to refer to the sum of advective and diffusive transfer . In common use the term `` convection '' may refer loosely to heat transfer by convection , as opposed to mass transfer by convection , or the convection process in general . Sometimes `` convection '' is even used to refer specifically to `` free heat convection '' ( natural heat convection ) as opposed to forced heat convection . However , in mechanics the correct use of the word is the general sense , and different types of convection should be qualified for clarity .

Cretaceous–Paleogene_extinction_event,0,"The Cretaceous -- Paleogene ( K -- Pg ) extinction event , also known as the Cretaceous -- Tertiary ( K -- T ) extinction , was a mass extinction of some three-quarters of the plant and animal species on Earth that occurred over a geologically short period of time approximately 65 million years ago . With the exception of some ectothermic species like the leatherback sea turtle and crocodiles , no tetrapods weighing more than 25 kg survived . It marked the end of the Cretaceous period and with it , the entire Mesozoic Era , opening the Cenozoic Era that continues today . In the geologic record , the K -- Pg event is marked by a thin layer of sediment called the K -- Pg boundary , which can be found throughout the world in marine and terrestrial rocks .

The impact hypothesis , also known as the Alvarez hypothesis , was bolstered by the discovery of the 180 km Chicxulub crater in the Gulf of Mexico in the early 1990s , which provided conclusive evidence that the K -- Pg boundary clay represented debris from an asteroid impact .

Density,0,"The density , or more precisely , the volumetric mass density , of a substance is its mass per unit volume .

In some cases ( for instance , in the United States oil and gas industry ) , density is loosely defined as its weight per unit volume , although this is scientifically inaccurate -- this quantity is more specifically called specific weight . For a pure substance the density has the same numerical value as its mass concentration . Different materials usually have different densities , and density may be relevant to buoyancy , purity and packaging . Osmium and iridium are the densest known elements at standard conditions for temperature and pressure but certain chemical compounds may be denser .

Density,1,"the ratio of the density of the material to that of a standard material , usually water . Thus a relative density less than one means that the substance floats in water . The density of a material varies with temperature and pressure . This variation is typically small for solids and liquids but much greater for gases . Increasing the pressure on an object decreases the volume of the object and thus increases its density . Increasing the temperature of a substance ( with a few exceptions ) decreases its density by increasing its volume . In most materials , heating the bottom of a fluid results in convection of the heat from the bottom to the top , due to the decrease in the density of the heated fluid . This causes it to rise relative to more dense unheated material . The reciprocal of the density of a substance is occasionally called its specific volume , a term sometimes used in thermodynamics . Density is an intensive property in that increasing the amount of a substance does not increase its density ; rather it increases its mass .",Fact checking,BeIR/climate-fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ
Desert,0,"A desert is a barren area of land where little precipitation occurs and consequently living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life .

Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls , by the temperature that prevails , by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location . Deserts are formed by weathering processes as large variations in temperature between day and night put strains on the rocks which consequently break in pieces . Although rain seldom occurs in deserts , there are occasional downpours that can result in flash floods . Rain falling on hot rocks can cause them to shatter and the resulting fragments and rubble strewn over the desert floor is further eroded by the wind .

Deforestation occurs for multiple reasons : trees are cut down to be used for building or sold as fuel , ( sometimes in the form of charcoal or timber ) , while cleared land is used as pasture for livestock and plantation . The removal of trees without sufficient reforestation has resulted in damage to habitat , biodiversity loss and aridity . It has adverse impacts on biosequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide .

Dengue is spread by several species of mosquito of the Aedes type , principally A. aegypti . The virus has five different types ; infection with one type usually gives lifelong immunity to that type , but only short-term immunity to the others .

Drowning itself is quick and silent , although it may be preceded by distress which is more visible . Generally , in the early stages of drowning , very little water enters the lungs : a small amount of water entering the trachea causes a muscular spasm that seals the airway and prevents the passage of both air and water until unconsciousness occurs . This means a person drowning is unable to shout or call for help , or seek attention , as they can not obtain enough air . The instinctive drowning response is the final set of autonomic reactions in the 20 -- 60 seconds before sinking underwater , and to the untrained eye can look similar to calm safe behavior .

This system is made up of earth 's water , ice , atmosphere , rocky crust , and all living things . Quantifying changes in these amounts is required to accurately model the Earth 's climate . Received radiation is unevenly distributed over the planet , because the Sun heats equatorial regions more than polar regions . Energy is absorbed by the atmosphere , hydrosphere , and lithosphere , and , in a process informally described as Earth 's heat engine , the solar heating is redistributed through evaporation of surface water , convection , rainfall , winds , and ocean circulation . When the incoming solar energy is balanced by an equal flow of heat to space , the Earth is said to be in radiative equilibrium and under that condition , global temperatures will be stable .

El_Niño–Southern_Oscillation,0,"El Niño -- Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) is an irregularly periodical variation in winds and sea surface temperatures over the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean , affecting much of the tropics and subtropics . The warming phase is known as El Niño and the cooling phase as La Niña . Southern Oscillation is the accompanying atmospheric component , coupled with the sea temperature change : El Niño is accompanied with high , and La Niña with low air surface pressure in the tropical western Pacific . The two periods last several months each ( typically occur every few years ) and their effects vary in intensity . The two phases relate to the Walker circulation , discovered by Gilbert Walker during the early twentieth century . The Walker circulation is caused by the pressure gradient force that results from a high pressure system over the eastern Pacific Ocean , and a low pressure system over Indonesia . When the Walker circulation weakens or reverses , an El Niño results , causing the ocean surface to be warmer than average , as upwelling of cold water occurs less or not at all .

Improvements in energy efficiency are generally achieved by adopting a more efficient technology or production process or by application of commonly accepted methods to reduce energy losses . There are many motivations to improve energy efficiency . Reducing energy use reduces energy costs and may result in a financial cost saving to consumers if the energy savings offset any additional costs of implementing an energy efficient technology . Reducing energy use is also seen as a solution to the problem of reducing greenhouse gas emissions .

In July 2016 , scientists reported identifying a set of 355 genes from the LUCA of all organisms living on Earth .

Thus , in successive generations members of a population are replaced by progeny of parents better adapted to survive and reproduce in the biophysical environment in which natural selection takes place . This teleonomy is the quality whereby the process of natural selection creates and preserves traits that are seemingly fitted for the functional roles they perform .

In the early 20th century the modern evolutionary synthesis integrated classical genetics with Darwin 's theory of evolution by natural selection through the discipline of population genetics . The importance of natural selection as a cause of evolution was accepted into other branches of biology . Moreover , previously held notions about evolution , such as orthogenesis , evolutionism , and other beliefs about innate `` progress '' within the largest-scale trends in evolution , became obsolete .

Theories of evolution provide a provisional explanation for these facts . Each of the words `` evolution '' , `` fact '' and `` theory '' has several meanings in different contexts . Evolution means change over time , as in stellar evolution .

Extinction_event,0,"An extinction event ( also known as a mass extinction or biotic crisis ) is a widespread and rapid decrease in the biodiversity on Earth .

Because the majority of diversity and biomass on Earth is microbial , and thus difficult to measure , recorded extinction events affect the easily observed , biologically complex component of the biosphere rather than the total diversity and abundance of life . Extinction occurs at an uneven rate . Based on the fossil record , the background rate of extinctions on Earth is about two to five taxonomic families of marine animals every million years . Marine fossils are mostly used to measure extinction rates because of their superior fossil record and stratigraphic range compared to land animals .

Fluid friction describes the friction between layers of a viscous fluid that are moving relative to each other . Lubricated friction is a case of fluid friction where a lubricant fluid separates two solid surfaces . Skin friction is a component of drag , the force resisting the motion of a fluid across the surface of a body . Internal friction is the force resisting motion between the elements making up a solid material while it undergoes deformation .

Another important consequence of many types of friction can be wear , which may lead to performance degradation or damage to components . Friction is a component of the science of tribology . Friction is desirable and important in supplying traction to facilitate motion on land . Most land vehicles rely on friction for acceleration , deceleration and changing direction . Sudden reductions in traction can cause loss of control and accidents . Friction is not itself a fundamental force . Dry friction arises from a combination of inter-surface adhesion , surface roughness , surface deformation , and surface contamination .

The dependence of GWP on the wavelength of absorption is more complicated . Even if a gas absorbs radiation efficiently at a certain wavelength , this may not affect its GWP much if the atmosphere already absorbs most radiation at that wavelength . A gas has the most effect if it absorbs in a `` window '' of wavelengths where the atmosphere is fairly transparent . The dependence of GWP as a function of wavelength has been found empirically and published as a graph .

Some small multicellular organisms , such as flatworms , are also able to perform sufficient gas exchange across the skin or cuticle that surrounds their bodies .

Glen_Canyon_Dam,1,"By the 1950s , due to rapid population growth in the seven U.S. and two Mexican states comprising the Colorado River Basin , the Bureau of Reclamation deemed the construction of additional reservoirs necessary . However , the USBR faced opposition when it proposed the Echo Park Dam in Utah 's Dinosaur National Monument , which the nascent environmental movement saw as a legal threat to the status of protected lands . After a long fight , the USBR agreed not to build the dam in Dinosaur , but only if the environmentalists did not oppose the proposed dam in Glen Canyon . Since first filling to capacity in 1980 , Lake Powell water levels have fluctuated greatly depending on water demand and annual runoff . Operation of Glen Canyon Dam helps ensure an equitable distribution of water between the states of the Upper Colorado River Basin ( Colorado , Wyoming , and most of New Mexico and Utah ) and the Lower Basin ( California , Nevada and most of Arizona ) . During years of drought , Glen Canyon guarantees a water delivery to the Lower Basin states , without the need for rationing in the Upper Basin .",Fact checking,BeIR/climate-fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

The long and winding Lake Powell , known for its scenic beauty and recreational opportunities including houseboating , fishing and water-skiing , attracts millions of tourists each year to the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area . In addition to its flooding of the scenic Glen Canyon , the dam 's economic justification was highly questioned ; with what critics saw as unnecessary damage to the wilderness , it became `` a catalyst for the modern environmental movement , '' and was one of the last dams of its size to be built in the United States . The dam has been criticized for the huge evaporative losses from Lake Powell and its heavy impact on the ecology of the Grand Canyon , which lies downstream ; environmental groups continue to advocate for the dam 's removal . Water managers and utilities state that the dam is a major source of renewable energy and provides a vital defense against severe droughts .",Fact checking,BeIR/climate-fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Part of this radiation is directed towards the surface , warming it . The downward component of this radiation -- that is , the strength of the greenhouse effect -- will depend on the atmosphere 's temperature and on the amount of greenhouse gases that the atmosphere contains . On Earth , the atmosphere is warmed by absorption of infrared thermal radiation from the underlying surface ( heated by the sun ) , absorption of shorter wavelength radiant energy from the sun , and convective heat fluxes from the surface . Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere radiate energy , some of which is directed to the surface and lower atmosphere . The mechanism that produces this difference between the actual surface temperature and the effective temperature is due to the atmosphere and is known as the greenhouse effect .

While these mechanisms have distinct characteristics , they often occur simultaneously in the same system . Heat conduction , also called diffusion , is the direct microscopic exchange of kinetic energy of particles through the boundary between two systems . When an object is at a different temperature from another body or its surroundings , heat flows so that the body and the surroundings reach the same temperature , at which point they are in thermal equilibrium . Such spontaneous heat transfer always occurs from a region of high temperature to another region of lower temperature , as described by the second law of thermodynamics .

The latter period marked a change in human history , as humans began the systematic husbandry of plants and animals . Agriculture advanced , and most humans transitioned from a nomadic to a settled lifestyle as farmers in permanent settlements . Nomadism continued in some locations , especially in isolated regions with few domesticable plant species , but the relative security and increased productivity provided by farming allowed human communities to expand into increasingly larger units , fostered by advances in transportation .

Jet_stream,0,"Jet streams are fast flowing , narrow , meandering air currents found in the atmosphere of some planets , including Earth . On Earth , the main jet streams are located near the altitude of the tropopause and are westerly winds ( flowing west to east ) . Their paths typically have a meandering shape . Jet streams may start , stop , split into two or more parts , combine into one stream , or flow in various directions including opposite to the direction of the remainder of the jet . The strongest jet streams are the polar jets , at 9 - above sea level , and the higher altitude and somewhat weaker subtropical jets at 10 - . The Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere each have a polar jet and a subtropical jet . The northern hemisphere polar jet flows over the middle to northern latitudes of North America , Europe , and Asia and their intervening oceans , while the southern hemisphere polar jet mostly circles Antarctica all year round .",Fact checking,BeIR/climate-fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ
Jet_stream,1,"Jet streams are the product of two factors : the atmospheric heating by solar radiation that produces the large scale Polar , Ferrel , and Hadley circulation cells , and the action of the Coriolis force acting on those moving masses . The Coriolis force is caused by the planet 's rotation on its axis . On other planets , internal heat rather than solar heating drives their jet streams . The Polar jet stream forms near the interface of the Polar and Ferrel circulation cells ; while the subtropical jet forms near the boundary of the Ferrel and Hadley circulation cells . Other jet streams also exist . During the Northern Hemisphere summer , easterly jets can form in tropical regions , typically where dry air encounters more humid air at high altitudes . Low-level jets also are typical of various regions such as the central United States . Meteorologists use the location of some of the jet streams as an aid in weather forecasting . The main commercial relevance of the jet streams is in air travel , as flight time can be dramatically affected by either flying with the flow or against , which results in significant fuel and time cost savings for airlines .",Fact checking,BeIR/climate-fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Leap_year,0,"A leap year ( also known as an intercalary year or bissextile year ) is a calendar year containing one additional day ( or , in the case of lunisolar calendars , a month ) added to keep the calendar year synchronized with the astronomical or seasonal year .

'' Evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence , machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data -- such algorithms overcome following strictly static program instructions by making data-driven predictions or decisions , through building a model from sample inputs . Machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks where designing and programming explicit algorithms with good performance is difficult or unfeasible ; example applications include email filtering , detection of network intruders or malicious insiders working towards a data breach , optical character recognition ( OCR ) , learning to rank and computer vision . Machine learning is closely related to ( and often overlaps with ) computational statistics , which also focuses on prediction-making through the use of computers .

Common micronutrient deficiencies include : a lack of iron , iodine , and vitamin A . During pregnancy , due to the body 's increased need , deficiencies may become more common . In some developing countries , overnutrition in the form of obesity is beginning to present within the same communities as undernutrition .

The energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in the gas . Natural gas is a fossil fuel used as a source of energy for heating , cooking , and electricity generation . It is also used as fuel for vehicles and as a chemical feedstock in the manufacture of plastics and other commercially important organic chemicals . Fossil fuel based natural gas is a non-renewable resource . Natural gas is found in deep underground rock formations or associated with other hydrocarbon reservoirs in coal beds and as methane clathrates .

Orbital resonances greatly enhance the mutual gravitational influence of the bodies , i.e. , their ability to alter or constrain each other 's orbits . In most cases , this results in an unstable interaction , in which the bodies exchange momentum and shift orbits until the resonance no longer exists . Under some circumstances , a resonant system can be stable and self-correcting , so that the bodies remain in resonance .

Some observers , such as petroleum industry experts Kenneth S.

In plants , algae and cyanobacteria , long-term energy storage in the form of sugars is produced by a subsequent sequence of reactions called the Calvin cycle ; some bacteria use different mechanisms , such as the reverse Krebs cycle , to achieve the same end .

Perceptual_control_theory,0,"Perceptual control theory ( PCT ) is a model of behavior based on the principles of negative feedback , but differing in important respects from engineering control theory . Results of PCT experiments have demonstrated that an organism controls neither its own behavior , nor external environmental variables , but rather its own perceptions of those variables . Actions are not controlled , they are varied so as to cancel the effects that unpredictable environmental disturbances would otherwise have on controlled perceptions . According to the standard catch-phrase of the field , `` behavior is the control of perception . '' PCT demonstrates circular causation in a negative feedback loop closed through the environment . This fundamentally contradicts the classical notion of linear causation of behavior by stimuli , in which environmental stimuli are thought to cause behavioral responses , mediated ( according to cognitive psychology ) by intervening cognitive processes . Numerous computer simulations of specific behavioral situations demonstrate its efficacy , with extremely high correlations to observational data ( 0.95 or better ) , which are vanishingly rare in the so-called ` soft ' sciences .",Fact checking,BeIR/climate-fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

This framework is based on scientific research that indicates that since the Industrial Revolution , human actions have gradually become the main driver of global environmental change . The scientists assert that once human activity has passed certain thresholds or tipping points , defined as `` planetary boundaries '' , there is a risk of `` irreversible and abrupt environmental change '' . The group identified nine Earth system processes which have boundaries that , to the extent that they are not crossed , mark the safe zone for the planet .

They then estimated how much further we can go before our own survival is threatened ; beyond these boundaries there is a risk of `` irreversible and abrupt environmental change '' which could make Earth less habitable . Estimates indicate that three of these boundaries -- climate change , biodiversity loss , and the biogeochemical flow boundary -- appear to have been crossed . The boundaries are `` rough , first estimates only , surrounded by large uncertainties and knowledge gaps '' that interact in ways that are complex and not well understood .

A typical photovoltaic system employs solar panels , each comprising a number of solar cells , which generate electrical power . PV installations may be ground-mounted , rooftop mounted or wall mounted . The mount may be fixed , or use a solar tracker to follow the sun across the sky . Solar PV has specific advantages as an energy source : its operation generates no pollution and no greenhouse gas emissions once installed , it shows simple scalability in respect of power needs and silicon has large availability in the Earth 's crust . PV systems have the major disadvantage that the power output is dependent on direct sunlight , so about 10-25 % is lost if a tracking system is not used , since the cell will not be directly facing the sun at all times .

The main forms of precipitation include drizzle , rain , sleet , snow , graupel and hail . Precipitation occurs when a portion of the atmosphere becomes saturated with water vapor , so that the water condenses and `` precipitates '' . Thus , fog and mist are not precipitation but suspensions , because the water vapor does not condense sufficiently to precipitate . Two processes , possibly acting together , can lead to air becoming saturated : cooling the air or adding water vapor to the air . Precipitation forms as smaller droplets coalesce via collision with other rain drops or ice crystals within a cloud . Short , intense periods of rain in scattered locations are called `` showers . '' Moisture that is lifted or otherwise forced to rise over a layer of sub-freezing air at the surface may be condensed into clouds and rain . This process is typically active when freezing rain is occurring .",Fact checking,BeIR/climate-fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ
Precipitation,1,"A stationary front is often present near the area of freezing rain and serves as the foci for forcing and rising air . Provided necessary and sufficient atmospheric moisture content , the moisture within the rising air will condense into clouds , namely stratus and cumulonimbus . Eventually , the cloud droplets will grow large enough to form raindrops and descend toward the Earth where they will freeze on contact with exposed objects . Where relatively warm water bodies are present , for example due to water evaporation from lakes , lake-effect snowfall becomes a concern downwind of the warm lakes within the cold cyclonic flow around the backside of extratropical cyclones . Lake-effect snowfall can be locally heavy . Thundersnow is possible within a cyclone 's comma head and within lake effect precipitation bands . In mountainous areas , heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation . On the leeward side of mountains , desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by compressional heating .",Fact checking,BeIR/climate-fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ
Precipitation,2,"The movement of the monsoon trough , or intertropical convergence zone , brings rainy seasons to savannah climes . Precipitation is a major component of the water cycle , and is responsible for depositing the fresh water on the planet . Approximately 505000 km3 of water falls as precipitation each year ; 398000 km3 of it over the oceans and 107000 km3 over land . Given the Earth 's surface area , that means the globally averaged annual precipitation is 990 mm , but over land it is only 715 mm . Climate classification systems such as the Köppen climate classification system use average annual rainfall to help differentiate between differing climate regimes . Precipitation may occur on other celestial bodies , e.g. when it gets cold , Mars has precipitation which most likely takes the form of frost , rather than rain or snow .",Fact checking,BeIR/climate-fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Since the coin is fair , the two outcomes ( `` heads '' and `` tails '' ) are both equally probable ; the probability of `` heads '' equals the probability of `` tails '' ; and since no other outcomes are possible , the probability of either `` heads '' or `` tails '' is 1/2 ( which could also be written as 0.5 or 50 % ) . These concepts have been given an axiomatic mathematical formalization in probability theory , which is used widely in such areas of study as mathematics , statistics , finance , gambling , science ( in particular physics ) , artificial intelligence/machine learning , computer science , game theory , and philosophy to , for example , draw inferences about the expected frequency of events .",Fact checking,BeIR/climate-fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Science,0,"Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe . Contemporary science is typically subdivided into the natural sciences , which study the material universe ; the social sciences , which study people and societies ; and the formal sciences , which study logic and mathematics . The formal sciences are often excluded as they do not depend on empirical observations . Disciplines which use science , like engineering and medicine , may also be considered to be applied sciences . From classical antiquity through the 19th century , science as a type of knowledge was more closely linked to philosophy than it is now , and in the Western world the term `` natural philosophy '' once encompassed fields of study that are today associated with science , such as astronomy , medicine , and physics . However , during the Islamic Golden Age foundations for the scientific method were laid by Ibn al-Haytham in his Book of Optics .

Salt_pannes_and_pools,0,"Salt pannes and pools are water retaining depressions located within salt and brackish marshes . Pools tend to retain water during the summer months between high tides , whereas pannes generally do not . Salt pannes generally start when a mat of organic debris ( known as wrack ) is deposited upon existing vegetation , killing it . This creates a slight depression in the surrounding vegetation which retains water for varying periods of time . Upon successive cycles of inundation and evaporation the panne develops an increased salinity greater than that of the larger body of water . This increased salinity dictates the type of flora and fauna able to grow within the panne . Salt pools are also secondary formations , though the exact mechanism ( s ) of formation are not well understood ; some have predicted they will increase in size and abundance in the future due to rising sea levels .",Fact checking,BeIR/climate-fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Satellite_television,0,"Satellite television is a service that delivers television programming to customers by relaying it from a communications satellite orbiting the Earth directly to the customer 's location . The signals are received via an outdoor parabolic antenna usually referred to as a satellite dish and a low-noise block downconverter . A satellite receiver then decodes the desired television programme for viewing on a television set . Receivers can be external set-top boxes , or a built-in television tuner . Satellite television provides a wide range of channels and services . It is the only television available in many remote geographic areas without terrestrial television or cable television service . Modern systems signals are relayed from a communications satellite on the Ku band frequencies ( 12 -- 18 GHz ) requiring only a small dish less than a meter in diameter . The first satellite TV systems were an obsolete type now known as television receive-only .

A common and relatively straightforward mean sea-level standard is the midpoint between a mean low and mean high tide at a particular location . Sea levels can be affected by many factors and are known to have varied greatly over geological time scales .

The exact meaning of surface varies according to the measurement method used , but it is between 1 mm and 20 m below the sea surface . Air masses in the Earth 's atmosphere are highly modified by sea surface temperatures within a short distance of the shore . Localized areas of heavy snow can form in bands downwind of warm water bodies within an otherwise cold air mass . Warm sea surface temperatures are known to be a cause of tropical cyclogenesis over the Earth 's oceans . Tropical cyclones can also cause a cool wake , due to turbulent mixing of the upper 30 m of the ocean . SST changes diurnally , like the air above it , but to a lesser degree .

Coastal SSTs can cause offshore winds to generate upwelling , which can significantly cool or warm nearby landmasses , but shallower waters over a continental shelf are often warmer . Onshore winds can cause a considerable warm-up even in areas where upwelling is fairly constant , such as the northwest coast of South America .

Melting of floating ice shelves or icebergs at sea raises sea levels only slightly . Sea level rise at specific locations may be more or less than the global average . Local factors might include tectonic effects , subsidence of the land , tides , currents , storms , etc. . Sea level rise is expected to continue for centuries .

Scientific_method,0,"The scientific method is a body of techniques for investigating phenomena , acquiring new knowledge , or correcting and integrating previous knowledge . To be termed scientific , a method of inquiry is commonly based on empirical or measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning . The Oxford Dictionaries Online define the scientific method as `` a method or procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century , consisting in systematic observation , measurement , and experiment , and the formulation , testing , and modification of hypotheses '' . Experiments need to be designed to test hypotheses . The most important part of the scientific method is the experiment . The scientific method is a continuous process , which usually begins with observations about the natural world . Human beings are naturally inquisitive , so they often come up with questions about things they see or hear and often develop ideas ( hypotheses ) about why things are the way they are . The best hypotheses lead to predictions that can be tested in various ways , including making further observations about nature . In general , the strongest tests of hypotheses come from carefully controlled and replicated experiments that gather empirical data .",Fact checking,BeIR/climate-fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ
Scientific_method,1,"Depending on how well the tests match the predictions , the original hypothesis may require refinement , alteration , expansion or even rejection . If a particular hypothesis becomes very well supported a general theory may be developed . Although procedures vary from one field of inquiry to another , identifiable features are frequently shared in common between them . The overall process of the scientific method involves making conjectures ( hypotheses ) , deriving predictions from them as logical consequences , and then carrying out experiments based on those predictions . A hypothesis is a conjecture , based on knowledge obtained while formulating the question . The hypothesis might be very specific or it might be broad . Scientists then test hypotheses by conducting experiments . Under modern interpretations , a scientific hypothesis must be falsifiable , implying that it is possible to identify a possible outcome of an experiment that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis ; otherwise , the hypothesis can not be meaningfully tested . The purpose of an experiment is to determine whether observations agree with or conflict with the predictions derived from a hypothesis .

The two simplest of these are called series and parallel and occur frequently . Components connected in series are connected along a single path , so the same current flows through all of the components . Components connected in parallel are connected , so the same voltage is applied to each component . A circuit composed solely of components connected in series is known as a series circuit ; likewise , one connected completely in parallel is known as a parallel circuit . In a series circuit , the current through each of the components is the same , and the voltage across the circuit is the sum of the voltages across each component . In a parallel circuit , the voltage across each of the components is the same , and the total current is the sum of the currents through each component . Consider a very simple circuit consisting of four light bulbs and one 6 V battery . If a wire joins the battery to one bulb , to the next bulb , to the next bulb , to the next bulb , then back to the battery , in one continuous loop , the bulbs are said to be in series .",Fact checking,BeIR/climate-fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

For example , with hybridisation , in a species complex of hundreds of similar microspecies , or in a ring species , the boundaries between closely related species become unclear . Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA , morphology , or ecological niche . All species are given a two-part name , a `` binomial '' .

Solubility,0,"Solubility is the property of a solid , liquid , or gaseous chemical substance called solute to dissolve in a solid , liquid , or gaseous solvent . The solubility of a substance fundamentally depends on the physical and chemical properties of the solute and solvent as well as on temperature , pressure and the pH of the solution . The extent of the solubility of a substance in a specific solvent is measured as the saturation concentration , where adding more solute does not increase the concentration of the solution and begins to precipitate the excess amount of solute . The solubility of a substance is an entirely different property from the rate of solution , which is how fast it dissolves . Most often , the solvent is a liquid , which can be a pure substance or a mixture . One may also speak of solid solution , but rarely of solution in a gas ( see vapor -- liquid equilibrium instead ) . The extent of solubility ranges widely , from infinitely soluble ( without limit ) ( fully miscible ) such as ethanol in water , to poorly soluble , such as silver chloride in water .",Fact checking,BeIR/climate-fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ
Solubility,1,"The term insoluble is often applied to poorly or very poorly soluble compounds . A common threshold to describe something as insoluble is less than 0.1 g per 100 mL of solvent . Under certain conditions , the equilibrium solubility can be exceeded to give a so-called supersaturated solution , which is metastable . Metastability of crystals can also lead to apparent differences in the amount of a chemical that dissolves depending on its crystalline form or particle size . A supersaturated solution generally crystallises when ` seed ' crystals are introduced and rapid equilibration occurs . Phenylsalicylate is one such simple observable substance when fully melted and then cooled below its fusion point . Solubility is not to be confused with the ability to ` dissolve ' a substance , because the solution might also occur because of a chemical reaction . For example , zinc ` dissolves ' ( with effervescence ) in hydrochloric acid as a result of a chemical reaction releasing hydrogen gas in a displacement reaction . The zinc ions are soluble in the acid .",Fact checking,BeIR/climate-fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

The report discusses the effect of global warming on the world economy . Although not the first economic report on climate change , it is significant as the largest and most widely known and discussed report of its kind . The Review states that climate change is the greatest and widest-ranging market failure ever seen , presenting a unique challenge for economics . The Review provides prescriptions including environmental taxes to minimise the economic and social disruptions . The Stern Review 's main conclusion is that the benefits of strong , early action on climate change far outweigh the costs of not acting . The Review points to the potential impacts of climate change on water resources , food production , health , and the environment .",Fact checking,BeIR/climate-fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Including a wider range of risks and impacts could increase this to 20 % of GDP or more , also indefinitely . Stern believes that 5 -- 6 degrees of temperature increase is `` a real possibility . '' The Review proposes that one percent of global GDP per annum is required to be invested to avoid the worst effects of climate change . In June 2008 , Stern increased the estimate for the annual cost of achieving stabilisation between 500 and 550 ppm CO2e to 2 % of GDP to account for faster than expected climate change . There has been a mixed reaction to the Stern Review from economists . Several economists have been critical of the Review , for example , a paper by Byatt et al.

The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of animated shorts with producer James L. Brooks . Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family , substituting Bart for his own name . The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19 , 1987 .

In some cases , theoretical physics adheres to standards of mathematical rigor while giving little weight to experiments and observations.There is some debate as to whether or not theoretical physics uses mathematics to build intuition and illustrativeness to extract physical insight ( especially when normal experience fails ) , rather than as a tool in formalizing theories . This links to the question of it using mathematics in a less formally rigorous , and more intuitive or heuristic way than , say , mathematical physics .

Tropical refers to the geographical origin of these systems , which form almost exclusively over tropical seas . Cyclone refers to their cyclonic nature , with wind blowing counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere .

Waste heat has lower utility ( or in thermodynamics lexicon a lower exergy or higher entropy ) than the original energy source . Sources of waste heat include all manner of human activities , natural systems , and all organisms . Instead of being `` wasted '' by release into the ambient environment , sometimes waste heat ( or cold ) can be utilized by another process ( such as using hot engine coolant to heat a vehicle ) , or a portion of heat that would otherwise be wasted can be reused in the same process if make-up heat is added to the system ( as with heat recovery ventilation in a building ) .

Viscosity,0,"The viscosity of a fluid is a measure of its resistance to gradual deformation by shear stress or tensile stress . For liquids , it corresponds to the informal concept of `` thickness '' ; for example , honey has a much higher viscosity than water . Viscosity is a property of the fluid which opposes the relative motion between the two surfaces of the fluid in a fluid that are moving at different velocities . When the fluid is forced through a tube , the particles which compose the fluid generally move more quickly near the tube 's axis and more slowly near its walls ; therefore some stress ( such as a pressure difference between the two ends of the tube ) is needed to overcome the friction between particle layers to keep the fluid moving . For a given velocity pattern , the stress required is proportional to the fluid 's viscosity . A fluid that has no resistance to shear stress is known as an ideal or inviscid fluid . Zero viscosity is observed only at very low temperatures in superfluids . Otherwise , all fluids have positive viscosity , and are technically said to be viscous or viscid .",Fact checking,BeIR/climate-fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Therefore , on Earth , volcanoes are generally found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging , and most are found underwater . For example , a mid-oceanic ridge , such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge , has volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates pulling apart ; the Pacific Ring of Fire has volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates coming together .

Volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic plates slide past one another . Erupting volcanoes can pose many hazards , not only in the immediate vicinity of the eruption .

Onshore wind is an inexpensive source of electric power , competitive with or in many places cheaper than coal or gas plants . Offshore wind is steadier and stronger than on land , and offshore farms have less visual impact , but construction and maintenance costs are considerably higher . Small onshore wind farms can feed some energy into the grid or provide electric power to isolated off-grid locations . Wind power gives variable power which is very consistent from year to year but which has significant variation over shorter time scales .

They measure radiances in various wavelength bands, which must then be mathematically inverted to obtain indirect inferences of temperature. The resulting temperature profiles depend on details of the methods that are used to obtain temperatures from radiances. As a result, different groups that have analyzed the satellite data  have obtained different temperature trends. Among these groups are Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) and the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). The satellite series is not fully homogeneous – the record is constructed from a series of satellites with similar but not identical instrumentation.",Fact checking,BeIR/climate-fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Tipping_points_in_the_climate_system,0,"A tipping point in the climate system is a threshold that, when exceeded, can lead to large changes in the state of the system. Potential tipping points have been identified in the physical climate system, in impacted ecosystems, and sometimes in both. For instance, feedback from the global carbon cycle is a driver for the transition between glacial and interglacial periods, with orbital forcing providing the initial trigger. Earth's geologic temperature record includes many more examples of geologically rapid transitions between different climate states.Climate tipping points are of particular interest in reference to concerns about global warming in the modern era. Possible tipping point behaviour has been identified for the global mean surface temperature by studying self-reinforcing feedbacks and the past behavior of Earth's climate system. Self-reinforcing feedbacks in the carbon cycle and planetary reflectivity could trigger a cascading set of tipping points that lead the world into a hothouse climate state.Large-scale components of the Earth system that may pass a tipping point have been referred to as tipping elements.",Fact checking,BeIR/climate-fever,dicta-il/dictalm2.0-AWQ

Climate_change_(general_concept),0,"Climate variability includes all the variations in the climate that last longer than individual weather events, whereas the term climate change only refers to those variations that persist for a longer period of time, typically decades or more. In the time since the industrial revolution the climate has increasingly been affected by human activities that are causing global warming and climate change.The climate system receives nearly all of its energy from the sun. The climate system also radiates energy to outer space. The balance of incoming and outgoing energy, and the passage of the energy through the climate system, determines Earth\'s energy budget. When the incoming energy is greater than the outgoing energy, earth\'s energy budget is positive and the climate system is warming. If more energy goes out, the energy budget is negative and earth experiences cooling.\nThe energy moving through Earth\'s climate system finds expression in weather, varying on geographic scales and time. Long-term averages and variability of weather in a region constitute the region\'s climate.
