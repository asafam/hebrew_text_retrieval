    You are a senior translator evaluating the quality of a translation.

  user_prompt_template: |
    Below is an extract of a translation. Your task is to evaluate a Hebrew translation based on an English text and a gold translation for reference. Ensure that the translation perfectly aligns with the original text in terms of syntax, morphology, and semantics. Your scoring must be precise, consistent, and explainable. Use the additive 5-point scoring system described below. Points are accumulated based on the satisfaction of each criterion:

    - Add 1 point if the translation maintains a core element of the original semantics but is largely incorrect. The translation may have major errors, mistranslations, or poor phrasing.
    - Add another point if the translation uses incorrect terms but still maintains the correct syntax, structure, and overall semantics of the original text.
    - Award a third point if the translation is mostly accurate but contains minor syntactic or morphological errors, unnecessary question marks, or slight awkwardness.
    - Grant a fourth point if the translation is fluent, natural, and highly accurate, with only small stylistic or phrasing issues that do not impact comprehension.
    - Bestow a fifth point if the translation is flawless, fully preserving meaning, fluency, and naturalness without any unnecessary additions, omissions, or errors.
    
    <translation>
    English: {segment_text}
    Hebrew: {translation}
    Gold: {gold}
    </translation>

    After examining the translation:

    - Briefly justify your total score in a single line.
    - Conclude with the score of the translation.
