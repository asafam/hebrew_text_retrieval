  system_prompt: |
    You are an expert at evaluating the quality of questions for their clarity, precision, and relevance. 
  user_prompt: |
    Your task is to evaluate whether a given question is valid according to the following criteria:
      1. Well-Defined and Unambiguous:
        * The question must be well-defined, ensuring clarity and precision. It should explicitly resolve references to relevant concepts, entities, or relationships unless those references are widely recognized as common knowledge.
        * Ensure the question includes necessary scope or context (e.g., time frame, location, or specific circumstances) to avoid ambiguity.
        * Avoid questions that rely solely on implicit information or assume additional details not present in the question.
      2. Natural Expression:
        * The question must sound natural, reflecting how humans typically ask questions in everyday communication.
        * It should strike a balance between informativeness—providing enough detail to be answerable—and conciseness, avoiding unnecessary verbosity or vagueness.
      3. Relevance and Focus:
        * The question must remain relevant to the topic at hand, focusing on essential details without being overly specific, overly broad, or ambiguous.
        * Avoid including redundant information or details that do not contribute meaningfully to the question's clarity or focus.


    When evaluating a question, assess whether it meets these criteria and determine if it communicates its intent effectively. 
    If the question is invalid or falls short in any area then also provide constructive feedback.

    Expected Output:
      * classification: [Valid | Invalid] If the question fully meets the criteria for being well-defined, unambiguous, natural, and relevant, or not.
      * explanation: Provide a brief explanation affirming why the question is valid or not.

    <examples>

    <example>
    Question: How many championship did the team won?
    Classification: Invalid
    Explanation: The question is vague and lacks specificity. The term "the team" is not explicitly resolved to a particular team in the question itself, relying on the context to clarify that it refers to the team discussed in the context passage. The question needis required to be self-contained and unambiguous, explicitly stating the team's name to avoid confusion or misinterpretation.
    </example>

    <example>
    Question: When did the Hundred Years' War between France and England started?
    Classification: Invalid
    Explanation: The phrase "between France and England" (between France and England) is redundant, as the common knowledge on the Hundred Years' War inherently implies this information. This makes the phrasing sound slightly unnatural, as people familiar with the topic typically omit this redundant detail.
    </example>

    <example>
    Question: Which family is considered one of few to have both a parent and a child winning the Nobel Prize?
    Classification: Invalid
    Explanation: The detail "one of few" is unnecessary in this context. This phrasing sounds overly formal and less natural for a conversational or typical query.
    </example>

    <example>
    Question: How many bases did Shohei Ohtani steal?
    Classification: Invalid
    Explanation: This question lacks specificity about the season or context (e.g., "in 2023"), which could confuse the audience or lead to ambiguous answers since Ohtani has played multiple seasons. 
    </example>

    <example>
    Question: In which city-state was the first democracy established, allowing citizens to participate directly in legislative and judicial decisions?
    Classification: Invalid
    Explanation: This question is overly verbose, included unnecessary details (e.g. "allowing citizens to participate directly in legislative and judicial decisions"), and lacked balance between clarity and conciseness, making it less natural.
    </example>

    <example>
    Question: Which band started at Gary, Indiana?
    Classification: Valid
    Explanation: The question is sufficiently clear and well-defined for a retrieval task. The context explicitly discusses "The Jackson Brothers" as a band that started its journey in Gary, Indiana. The question does not require additional specificity because the association between the band's starting location (Gary, Indiana) and the context is direct and unambiguous.
    </example>

    <example>
    Question: Who played Frank Constanza?
    Classification: Valid
    Explanation: The question is specific and does not leave room for multiple interpretations. The phrasing is natural and aligns with how people typically ask about actors portraying specific characters. The question is concise, directly relevant to the topic, and does not include any unnecessary details.
    </example>

    <example>
    Question: Where did the US Airways flight 1549 emergency landed?
    Classification: Valid
    Explanation: The question is specific and leaves no room for ambiguity. The phrasing is natural and reflects how people typically ask such a question in everyday communication. The question is concise and focused on the key detail (the city where the emergency landing occurred). It avoids unnecessary verbosity or unrelated information.
    </example>

  system_prompt: |
    You are an expert language model trained to assist with editing a question suitable for retrieval tasks.
  user_prompt: |
    You will receive an original question, its associated context, and the answer. 
    Your task is to suggest minimal edits to make the question valid according to the following criteria:
      * Well-Defined and Unambiguous: The question must be well-defined, ensuring clarity and precision. It should explicitly resolve references to relevant concepts, entities, or relationships unless those references are widely recognized as common knowledge. Ambiguity must be avoided to ensure the question is clear and leaves no room for misinterpretation.
      * Natural Expression: The question must sound natural, reflecting how humans typically ask questions in everyday communication. It should strike a balance between informativeness—providing enough detail to be answerable—and conciseness, avoiding unnecessary verbosity or vagueness.
      * Relevance and Focus: The question must remain relevant to the topic at hand, focusing on essential details without being overly specific, overly broad, or ambiguous.

    ## Guidelines
    
    1. Edit the question such that it exhibits:
      * Clarity and Definition: Ensure the question is well-defined, specific, and unambiguous.
      * Naturalness: Rewrite the question so it sounds natural and conversational.
      * Informativeness: Include enough detail to make it answerable without being verbose or vague.
      * Relevance: Focus on essential details from the context, avoiding irrelevant or external information.
    
    2. Use the following edit types as necessary:
      * NAME COMPLETION, PRONOUN/NP SWAP: Replace unclear pronouns or noun phrases with explicit, unambiguous references (e.g., "מיכאל איתן" or "מייגן 'מג' גריפין").
      * BRIDGING: Add modifiers or phrases to nouns to clarify their meaning (e.g., "ב-UFC" or "של הסדרה איש משפחה").
      * GLOBAL SCOPING: Add modifiers to the entire question for clarity (e.g., "מול ביתר ירושלים").
      * ADDITION: Add background information for de-ambiguitating the question and improving readability (e.g., replacing "האיגלס" with "להקת האיגלס").
  
    3. Indicate the type of edit you applied to make the question suitable for retrieval -- select one of the edit types: NAME COMPLETION, PRONOUN/NP SWAP, DETERMINER EDITING, BRIDGING, GLOBAL SCOPING, ADDITION
    
    4. Make only one minimal edit when possible. Clearly label the type of edit you applied.

    5. If the question is already valid, output it unchanged.

    6. The edited question cannot contain the answer.

    <examples>

    <example>
    Context: Megan "Meg" Griffin is a fictional character in the animated television series Family Guy. Meg is the eldest child of Peter and Lois Griffin and older sister of Stewie and Chris. Originally voiced by Lacey Chabert during the first season, Meg has been voiced by Mila Kunis since season 2.
    Question: Who voiced Meg in the first season?
    Answer: Lacey Chabert
    Edited question: Who voiced Megan "Meg" Griffin in the first season?
    Edit: NAME COMPLETION
    Explanation: The edit applies NAME COMPLETION by including the full name "Megan 'Meg' Griffin" instead of just "Meg" to provide clarity and precision. This ensures that the question is unambiguous, especially in contexts where "Meg" might refer to another character or person. The edit is minimal and maintains the natural flow and relevance of the question.
    </example>

    <example>
    Context: UFC matches vary in maximum length, depending on whether the match is for a championship title, or is a fight card's "main event" fight. In all fights, each round can be no longer than five minutes. Championship fights last for a maximum of five rounds.
    Question: How long is a round?
    Answer: Each round can be no longer than five minutes
    Edited question:  How long is a round in UFC fights?
    Edit: BRIDGING
    Explanation: The edit applies BRIDGING to clarify the context of the question by adding "in UFC fights." This ensures the question is well-defined and explicitly linked to the context of UFC matches, avoiding ambiguity about what type of rounds are being referred to. The edit maintains naturalness and relevance while improving clarity.
    </example>

    <example>
    Context: With the best-of-five series tied at two games apiece and the Cavaliers leading the game by one point with three seconds left, Bulls player Michael Jordan received an inbound pass and made a buzzer-beater shot to give the Bulls a 101–100 win and clinch a series victory.
    Question: On which game did Jordan hit the shot?
    Answer: On game 5 between the Bulls and Cavaliers
    Edited question: On which game did Jordan hit the shot against the Cavaliers?
    Edit: GLOBAL SCOPING
    Explanation: The edit applies GLOBAL SCOPING by adding "against the Cavaliers" to explicitly define the context of the game in question. This ensures the question is well-defined and avoids ambiguity, particularly in scenarios where Michael Jordan's career is being discussed, and multiple buzzer-beater shots could be relevant. The edit retains naturalness and relevance while providing the necessary specificity.
    </example>

    <example>
    Context: The Eagles are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1971. Having not settled on a band name yet, they performed their first show in October 1971 under the name of Teen King and the Emergencies at a club called The Gallery in Aspen.
    Question: When was the Eagles' first concert?
    Answer: October 1971
    Edited question: When was the Eagles band's first concert?
    Edit: ADDITION
    Explanation: The edit applies ADDITION by specifying "band" in "Eagles band" to ensure clarity and avoid potential ambiguity, as "Eagles" could be interpreted as something other than the rock band (e.g., a sports team). This minimal addition ensures the question is well-defined and unambiguous while maintaining naturalness and relevance.
    </example>

    <example>
    Context: George W. Bush's tenure as the 43rd president of the United States began with his first inauguration on January 20, 2001, and ended on January 20, 2009. Bush served two terms and was succeeded by Democrat Barack Obama, who won the 2008 presidential election. He is the eldest son of the 41st president, George H. W. Bush.
    Question: Who was the president after Bush?
    Answer: Barack Obama
    Edited question: Who was the president after George W. Bush?
    Edit: NAME COMPLETION
    Explanation: The edit applies NAME COMPLETION by replacing "Bush" with "George W. Bush" to eliminate ambiguity. Since both George W. Bush and his father, George H. W. Bush, served as presidents, the original question could be misinterpreted. The edit ensures the question is well-defined and unambiguous while maintaining its natural and relevant phrasing.
